6251359,1,So I gave this place a bad review the first time and haven't been back. Today I tried it again and walked in to the host SITTING behind the table on her PHONE.. looked up once while continuing to play on her phone and stated it will be an hour wait.. completely unprofessional and very rude and I will NEVER try again,0
6128778,2,Flowers looked good. They dropped them off hours before they should and just like I was worried about my gf co-workers texted her and ruined the whole surprise. Paying $100+ I expect her to be surprised at work. Really really bummed me out.  Flowers were nice but also looked a little different then the pictures online.,0
2758457,1,"As I sit here I am watching the cook wipe the sweat off his head then handle the food. To add to this he is not wearing a mask. There are signs in here that clearly say ""no mask no service""  I'm pretty grossed out at the moment and am really wanting to cancel my order. If COVID is fake to you ok but the fact that he's putting his face oils and sweat into my food is repulsive. Also if you're going to handle peoples food maybe gloves may be appropriate.",0
427928,1,"This is not another Patron review made by many after losing at slot machines andTable Games! This review is why I have fallen out of love with the once amazing Hard Rock Staff. 

I frequently visit the casino and of course that means suspending a lot of money in the Seminole establishment.  I've been a Wild Card Member over 9 years. I've enjoyed the times spent with family and friends, until recently. 

I've seen a HUGE decline in customer service from cocktail waitresses, to slot managers, and unfortunately even the players club management (I don't have any complaints about the players club team members themselves because they are Extremely helpful and polite) 

Lately every time we spend a night or day at the Casino its been nothing but a headache, that leaves all of us with a.horrible taste in our mouths.. I have requested for upper management to reach out to me in regards to the past 3 incidents not only by 1 member of your management team; but 3. No-one has given me a courtesy call or even reached out to me. 

I mean come on Hard Rock, 

Corporate asked me to file a report with the security manager on duty so the incident could be handled by the proper chain of command. The way the it was handled was unheard of! I was reassured that she would NOT be reaching out to me, at all. After I insisted she had my contact information. I only this I requested was to be informed of the outcome after coaching the security guard who verbally attacked and embarrassed my son in-laws fiancé, and myself. 

I am beyond disappointed in the staff professionalism.

Being a business owner myself, I would never hire employees who speak in an abusive manner to my customers. Better yet - I wouldn't keep them around if they treated a human the way we have been treated. 

Yet those same unprofessional employees continue to be employed with the Seminole Hard rock and continue to harass my family to the point we feel uncomfortable and don't want to comeback to the hard rock. Which is disappointing because it once was such a blessing to have a casino so close to home. I guess we will be taking our business to a establishment where we are treated with respect and decency.  

I will be letting my friends, family and the network I am apart of know exactly what kinds of individuals continue to be employed even after their embarrassing actions to their place of employment, and sadly how the management staff has failed to keep the management skills that I'm sure got them to the position they have. They should be leading by example and it surly shows what kind of examples have been set to the staff they manage. 

So I will end this review with a question? 

Where is the Hard Rock we Loved so much the one where loosing money almost everyday didn't matter?


Get it together hard rock you are better than this!",0
5969501,1,"Wow. Just wow. This review is directed at the pharmacist, (which she didn't give me her name), as well as Jen the ""manager on duty"" and poor Stacey the pharmacy manager that the pharmacist threw under the bus because she didn't want to take the blame for not doing her job. Stacey is not even at work right now, but that's the name she gave me. I am totally calling corporate because I think the owners of the store that give you a paycheck would love to know that you are uninterested in helping anyone, especially since your store is the ONLY 24 hour pharmacy. I told you I would be putting this on Yelp so I know you are looking for it.

I called to ask a question about Tylenol. I was put on hold at the pharmacy for 17 minutes, no one ever answered. I hung up the phone and called back. I asked the girl at the front if there was anyone working in the pharmacy because I've been on hold for a long time and I just had a quick question. She said yes hold on one second and transferred me back. I waited another 10 minutes on hold. I called back and asked for the manager, she hung up on me. I called back and asked for the manager again, she put me on hold for six minutes. I called back and just asked for the managers name. Only this time apparently the pharmacist answered the phone, probably because heard I was so upset, and quickly pushed it off as she's the only one there and no one paged her. Never heard an apology, never really wanted one. I just want her to know, how important her job is. People are calling her for help with their HEALTH... And she cares not.


I know you're probably working the night shift because it pays a couple of dollars more, but you should probably switch to the dayshift since you do not have as much responsibility that is left just on you. Leave the night shift to people that truly care about helping people...

Also, just like I said on the phone, you work with the public, if you can't handle that, find a new job. CUSTOMER SERVICE....",0
5859135,1,"This is the worst service at Waffle House I have ever experienced. We've been sitting here for almost 30 minutes and have not received a menu, asked our drink orders, or any service of that matter. I am highly upset and disgusted with the service that I am receiving and DO NOT recommend this place to anyone after about 2 o clock because the service is HORRIBLE!!!!",0
4856962,1,"I have not received my home delivered newspaper since 11/21/21. I've called and the only people I can talk to are their outsourced customer service representatives.  They apologize profusely and then tell you a bunch of lies such as they will contact dispatch and have a paper delivered (never happens), or when I request to speak with my district manager they tell me that the district manager will call me (never happens).  I've been a Reno Gazette Journal customer for almost 20 years.  Their customer service, delivery service and the paper itself has diminished over the years.  Cancelling my newspaper would be a lot less frustrating.",0
3478326,1,"I went to go get some poster work done for my studio. Figure they were in the neighborhood and I would give them a shot. Job was supposed to take 2 hours, it took over 12 hours and when I went to go and pick it up the color was completely off.  When I confronted the tech about the colors he told me oh know they look the same..( thought to myself we have a problem this guy works at print area and can't see that there is two different colours)
   Manager finally came over look at the print he says I will redo it come back in 2 hours.  Went back and I was told they weren't able to match the colors need the original download file , and I politely ask them how could you not match colors that it was your stock print they had no answer.( its funny to see two guys just stare at one another with no answer...)
     Being in business  for myself I figured I would give them a second chance, decided to get some more work done at the same location.

My order was placed at 2:54 p.m. to be picked up in 4 hours, went to go pick it up at 7:35 pm it was not printed yet girl told me to come back in 20 minutes. went back over an hour later and it still was not printed. well as you could see I am NOT happy with the customer service at this Staples.
My feeling is if you have people working into a copy print shop they need to be able to carry out orders for all the work of that day, evidently they are slow and some extremely rude like you're bothering them I'm sorry maybe I'm wrong but it's your job.


Sincerely Teri,",0
5519995,2,"I left a rechargeable battery with them a month ago and was told that it would take a week or two because they currently cannot work on rechargeable batteries. As of today it's still not done and I don't know if it will be done, so I'm out $45 in a time when I don't have a lot to spare. There's no organization to anything they're doing. At this point I feel the other store will work on it only if they aren't busy with their own customers.",0
41424,1,Not impressed at all. It took them 15 minutes to seat my party for breakfast. They were busy but not that busy. Once we ordered we waited a little over 45 minutes for our food. That is absolutely ridiculous to wait that long for a dinner order let alone a breakfast order. The food wasn't even that good either. I will not be going back here.,0
2537426,1,"Happened upon the awful staff at Chad's and was so appalled that I had to write a review. If they treat their bar/restaurant customers as well as they treat well-meaning passers-by, they won't be in business long. 

Chad's is located in a dingy, ugly strip mall with inadequate parking for the number of little shops that line the strip. I was there for another business and a spot in front of Chad's was open with no sign to indicate that it was reserved for their customers. Two of Chad's employees were outside and although there were other spots open in the lot still, they asked me to move my car to the parking lot across the street to make room for all their customers (not a single Chad's customer in sight might I add on a Friday night). 

The female employee was normal about it, but the male employee (who looked kind of like the guy from Clerks, but uglier, meaner) was incredibly rude! And I said so. Well he went off at me. ""You F*@kin' b!t@h, I'll say it however I want to. I'll $h!t on your car!"" Seriously, he said he would defecate on my vehicle. WTF.

I would never, ever eat at Chad's and I hope that tool loses his job over this review.",0

5025028,2,"Far too loud for any conversation. They see fit to allow children to wander around. If that isn't your scene - it certainly isn't mine - I'd avoid this place. The menu is fairly inventive. However, if you have any dietary restrictions or food allergies, I wouldn't take the chance at having a meal here. I asked the waitress a few questions about certain items. She either mentioned way more ingredients than were listed in the menu or had no idea how the dish was prepared. The interior is just as kitschy as the exterior, continuing on with their submarine theme. If you're really jonesin' to eat in a loud submarine, look no farther. If you want to be able to hear the people you're with, eat in peace, and know for certain that you won't wind up in a hospital, avoid them like... well... the plague.",0
5247120,1,"Horrible experience with the owner/manager when I went in to use a BOGO coupon I received in an email, the email  stated the coupon had to be printed for use in specific stores- this was not one of them. At check out she said that it had to be printed out, in a condescending tone she said if I had told her before she started my order she would have stated that from the beginning. There were other people in the store and she was the only one there so I didn't want to be that person holding it up.  In the end the coupon was useless, I submitted a complaint to corporate which went nowhere, and I over paid for sub par ice cream.",0
2064794,1,"The absolute worst staff of anywhere I have eaten in 30 years. The ""I hate my job and don't care about serving customers"" look and attitude from the workers is glaringly obvious. As others have mentioned, they are constantly out of items on the line and don't seem to care. There seems to be lots of people employed but rarely more than 1 person making food for those dining in causing long lines that don't move and numerous people waiting for call in orders standing around pissed off because this place can't get the food out. Save yourself the aggravation and go elsewhere! This place needs corporate to come in, fire everyone including the manager who apparently doesn't know how to hire good workers or staff for peak times. If this is franchised, the person should be stripped of this store. Either fix it or close it down as it is ruining your brand which at other locations is good.",0

I've been around the night life long enough to know what they're trying to accomplish in terms of being ""exclusive"". Despite her saying she couldn't accommodate us, we sat ourselves at the bar when a couple got up. We were there for two hours. The place was still empty when we left.",0

1883828,2,"We had the crab claws and stuffed mushroom appetizers. In my opinion the crab claws were probably the only decent thing we had. Neither of the 6 of us cared for the mushrooms. We also got chargrilled oysters that were small and not worth $20 at all. For entrees we ordered the seafood boiling pot, shrimp boiling pot, rib eye, fried seafood platter, oyster pasta, and the soup trio. ALL of our entrees lacked so much flavor. My friend probably took 2 bites of her pasta and pushed it aside. The seafood platter was room temperature and just overall mediocre. My friend hated the soup trio and said it tasted nothing like jambalaya, etoufee, or red beans. The boiling pots lacked so much flavor that we expected since we are in New Orleans.. AND they were supposed to come with corn, which we never got. And when I asked my server if it was supposed to come with it she said yes but we probably ran out since it's the end of the night. It would have been nice to have been offered a substitution or be told they were out to begin with. They probably hoped we wouldn't notice. And the rib eye was just ok. We didn't even want to order dessert for our friends birthday. Would probably never come here again since we paid almost $400 for a meal we all werent the least bit satisfied with. And for $400 we never even got a single drink refill. Save your money and go elsewhere. WOULDNT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE",0
6358444,2,"I am so disappointed with Yard House. Tonight was my first time there. My son and I came about 6:45. We had a 20 min. wait but we didn't mind. We were seated in a very nice, open dining area and I liked the atmosphere. 
I tried a pineapple cocktail, a sort of mojito. It was pricey at $10.25 but delicious. I thought it was a good start. 
I ordered 2 ala carte tacos. I told our waitress,Michelle, that I don't eat spicy foods at all. She told me that what I ordered was fine if they left off sauces. The first taco, the 'vampire' was very spicy anyway and I couldn't eat it so she brought me a second carnitas taco. It was good, nothing special,but good. I subbed the truffle fries for the rice and beans for an additional dollar. They were awful!!
Frozen shoestring fries with an oily topping that was truffle oil, I assume. It's an hour+ later and I'm still trying to get the oily taste out of my mouth. I was really hungry so I ate them even though they were terrible. And they charge $5.45 on the menu for this frozen mess. My son had the BBQ chicken salad and he enjoyed it. Maybe if I had gotten something different...  
On the plus side, the ambience was nice and our server, Michelle was wonderful.",0

5287380,1,"I've been to mad donnas 3 times and I will say they are consistent. Unfortunately it is consistently bad. They have .99 cent tacos on Mondays with $5 margaritas. Sounds good right? Well they need to change the name to 99 minute tacos as it took an hour and a half to get our tacos out. The drinks are all over the place and the margaritas taste different each time. 
We've tried the burgers and wings and neither warrant a second chance. Patio is only good thing about this place even if it looks rather sterile. 
Just not worth it even though I live in the neighborhood.",0
2134138,1,"I stopped by for a pre-vacation pedicure after shopping at Target. I was seated immediately, which was nice. So immediately, however, that I forgot to get a magazine. I was handed over to a nice older gentleman, and I tried to ask for one, but he spoke no English, so I was met with a blank (not unkind, just blank) stare. There was a huge ladder in the middle of the floor, apparently to repair something in the ceiling. Could this not wait until closing? Odd.
So we begin. The water was freezing cold, and he did not let me soak my feet for 30 seconds.  Not kiddng--NO SOAKING. This is significant, because he immediately set in with that scary cheese grater thing. He must've sanded floors or participated in whittling contests in the past, because this is what he did to my feet. No amount of flinching or painful exclamations slowed him down. He was determined. Granted, my feet are dreadful from running. I tried to tell him to leave some skin on (not joking!) because I can't run or walk when they're whittled down to bare bone. Again, no evidence of comprehension. 
When he had drawn blood on the left heel, he decided he was finished. Next, he trotted out the cuticle scissors. I've never had them used on my toes, and don't have manicures because of bad experiences with those nasty instruments of torture. I shook my head, but, again, nothing.  A normal person would've walked out at that point, but I wasn't sure I could, given the skinning my heels had just endured. 
So he cuts and pushes REALLY hard with some sharp instrument into my cuticles for what seemed an hour. I couldn't watch at that point. Other employees kept coming by and looking at my feet, then looking at him and making comments in a language I don't understand. This was not comforting. I had paid extra for exfoliation, so you can guess what came next. Shards of glass being pushed with the full body weight of a grown man into my lower legs, as if he were scrubbing a really dirty floor. I flinched and cringed and gritted my teeth. Hot towels were then placed on the open wounds, then it was time for polish. He seemed nervous, bless him, and redid my big toe three times. Three. He then rushed me out of the seat to the dryer and I nicked the big toe in the sprint. I wasn't about to ask him to fix it, so I let it go. After the drying, I shuffled, in the salon-issue, hot pink paper thin sandals, to my car, parked waaaayy too far away. And get this:  I had forgotten my keys and had to shuffle back in there---aaaggghhhhh!!! I walked the dogs this morning with 4 band-aids over the tender spots. No more Viva Nails for this over exfoliated woman!",0

6834466,1,"I'm shocked to learn that this many people like this place.  The owner is rude and he treats his employees terribly.  The service is horrible and overpriced, they try to make it relaxing, but between the owner yelling at his employees and all the snotty nail techs judging every person in the salon, it is anything but relaxing.  This place is awful, go to Euphoria Nail Bar across the street, it's as clean and the people are lovely.",0
6283890,2,"Beware of the membership cancellation terms.

I've gone to this location for at least 2 years. Until recently, I did see a couple therapists regularly that are excellent workers. Unfortunately, the schedule has become more booked for the young lady I was seeing regularly in recent months. So, I decided to schedule with a different therapist a few months ago, who twice had to cancel my sessions due to illness or other personal reasons. Eventually, I had a massage booked early October, which was of mediocre quality.

After all that, I decided to cancel my membership. Members are charged automatically each month regardless if a session is booked. I'm told that there are 3.5 hours of credit on my account. According to company policy, unused credits are nonrefundable. Even after explaining scheduling conflicts, and a half-hearted massage session, the company won't refund my account credit in any form. Since credits are only good for massage sessions, and can't be used for tipping therapists, I'd rather cut my losses.

There are some good workers at this location.  Until my last massage a month ago, I've had some great sessions here.  However, the no refund policy for unused funds is ridiculous and unjust. I recently filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well, in the small hope that makes a difference and I can get my account funds back.",0
1960359,1,"Save yourself time and aggravation and stay far far away from here. This place is completely unprofessional and disrespectful of their clients' time. My first appointment took a total of two hours, most of which was waiting around. I was not seen until almost 30 minutes after my appointment time. I was told to return for a follow up the next week and after waiting for 20 minutes was told that Dr. Daphne Richardson had not even arrived at work yet and there was someone else ahead of me. Not only that, but the person who checked me out on my first appointment tried to charge me for the eye exam, which is covered by my insurance. She had a very hard time figuring out how to do what I assume is her job. This is after I paid an extra $165 for an additional service I was not counting on. Also, the glasses that I received on the prescription I was given are not correct. I can't use them. I have no faith in Dr. Richardson or in any of her staff.",0
1755871,2,"Check your carry out order.  This Chick-fil-A sometimes messes up your carry out order.  I drove with my kids 20 minutes to this Chick-fil-A.  We took our food home to eat while we watched a movie.  Chick-fil-A had omitted a $9 salad.  I called them.  They told me the salad would be ready when I got there since everyone at home wanted to wait so we could eat together.  When I got there, they didn't have it ready...they had to go back and make one.  So frustrated.  For the drive and waiting time, it ended up being a 50 minute experience.  The compensation was a coupon for a free sandwich.  So frustrated!",0
535799,2,"I stood at the counter in an otherwise empty restaurant for nearly 5 minutes before the 2 staff members stopped chatting and decided to acknowledge me.  ""Have you decided what you want to order?""  Yes, that was actually decided BEFORE I walked up to the cash register and stood there (for what felt like forever) like an awkward wallflower waiting for a prom date who isn't coming.  I ordered a bowl with rice and chickpeas and asked if it had cheese on it.  I was asked if I wanted chicken.  I repeated my cheese question and was again asked if I wanted protein.  I replied ""No protein.  Is there cheese on the salad?""  She replied by adding cheese to my order, which I did not want.  When all was said and done I paid over $10 for a sad but healthy little salad with barely 1/4 cup of rice and a sprinkling of chickpeas.  In the time it took to order and receive my order I could have walked across the street to Pizza Hut and ordered their special of the day, a medium Supreme Lovers pizza...also priced at $10.  Sure, I'd be a little fatter but I'd also be happy, full and not writing this review.

The place is small, not the cleanest and a bit ghetto. The owner then just said""hi it'll be a 40 minute wait"". I said no problem. None of the employees or owner gave me a box to choose my colors from. Again, it was my first time so I wasn't sure where where the gel polish were. I sat there for 20 mins wondering if they would hand me something to choose my colors from. Nope, I had to ask a customer next to me. Second, my gel nails didn't turn out that great. When I was finished the tip of my nails looked faded.  Also, after a few days my gel nails started to peel off!!!!. I was a so unhappy with the results.

3109200,1,"The first time I came here for dinner, it was not very good. The food is pricey for Mexican, the server rushed us through our meal and the burrito was very basic compared to ones at Juan's Flying Burrito. The only things the place had going for it were the 18 oz Dos Equis draft for $4 and the salsa. I'm here now for lunch even though I swore never to return.  The only spot without a wait was at the bar, but I think we would have done much better waiting the 20 minutes for a regular table. For one, you don't get the free chips and salsa here like you do at a table. And secondly, we were there over 45 minutes before our food ever came.  I will say the burrito I got this time was much better than the one I had during my previous visit.  It had grilled shrimp and pineapple, but that was the only good part about it.  Save yourself time and money and go somewhere else.",0

I called to place an order for pick up at 7:30pm on 12/13/2015. The person who took my order gave me a total that was well above what the total should have been. I was looking at their current prices on their menu on GrubHub, and was about to order online, but decided to call it in instead. I placed my order and he gave me the final total, it was significantly higher than what it should have been. 

When I called back and began pointing out the 35% difference in pricing, he proceeded to tell me that GrubHub prices were wrong, and then thanked me for pointing it out. He then sarcastically told me that he would charge me the exact same price, regardless of me pointing out the error. When I told him that it did not seem fair, and that I would like to cancel my order, he proceeded to rudely hang up on me. 

This franchise does not value its customers and clearly needs a lesson in etiquette. Luckily now I can cross them off my list of places to eat in Newtown.",0

But when we waited an hour for our food and the party that came after us was eating before us, I knew it was going to be an issue. We ate planning on playing games, so we ordered the eat and play combos. Well. What NO ONE decided to tell us is that the system was down that loads the power cards. Needless to say, we were pissed. Jennifer have us some discount cards where if we spent 20 bucks, we would get 20 off and hurried off to charge our cards. Well, as soon as I saw a manager, I called him over AND HE IGNORED ME. I found out later that his name was Eric. Well, he said he took 20 bucks off of our bill and canceled the previous transaction. Nope. He charged me twice and not only that, they didn't separate the checks properly. I was charged for two cranberry juices, we only drank one. I was also charged for the other parties kids drink. I mean, come on!!! I found out later that the system crashed shortly before we got there so they had plenty of time to notify us of the issue but chose not to. Honestly, I used to come here a lot years ago, but they will not get my business ever again if this is what I have to look forward to. I could've done without the discount cards and the 20 bucks off of the bill if I just would've had someone competent enough to be thoughtful and polite. Never, ever, ever again.

766080,1,"I have no idea why anyone would give this place a positive rating. 
After a booze fueled weekend at the Marriott  waterside we decided to end the weekend with a fine dining experience that Sunday night. 
The Jackson has a beautiful layout and great view. That's about it. 
The ginormous menu should have been a red flag but I'll give anyplace a try. 
Our waiter was either brand new or off his meds because the service was terrible. Didn't bring the appetizers we ordered and didn't tell us when items were out in the kitchen. Second red flag. 
I don't mind paying great money for great food but the two lifeless flavorless sushi rolls I ordered were not worth it. 
The Jackson needs to decide wether it wants to be a great restaurant or stay as a nightclub that serves shitty food during the day. 
Save your time, money and effort and go elsewhere.",0

1722165,2,"My boyfriend and I grabbed an early lunch here today. He ordered the brisket sandwich and I had the pasta special... which was indeed quite ""special"".  The waiter advertised the pasta as penne with Irish sausage, basil, roasted tomatoes and a lemony cream sauce.  What I got was inedible, slimy sausage with the consistency of vienna sausage and a just-about-to-turn sort of flavor with asparagus, summer squash, capers and green onions in a flavorless alfredo sauce. While the roasted asparagus pieces and squash were pretty good and I did enjoy the capers, this dish was not even close to what the waiter said  it would be.  About half way through picking around the disgusting sausage, I was surprised to chomp down on a chard of bone about the size of half a penny.  Thank goodness I have strong teeth and an even stronger stomach.  

My boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich well enough after picking large hunks of congealed fat from it.  

The staff was really nice.

It wasn't worth the $30 we spent.  I don't think the boyfriend will be able to convince me to go back.",0
2411451,2,"My husband and I went on the Friendly Planet Thailand tour in 2007; the tour was okay, but I must share the negative experience we've had with the ""teak"" furniture we purchased at Chiangmai Sudaluck Company, Ltd., one of the stops on the way to northern Thailand.  We purchased 4 ""teak"" chairs, 4 foot stools and 2 tables, paying over $7,000, and had them shipped back home. The furniture had a heavy stain on them.  Over the past year, the stain has worn (expected) - what wasn't expected is what we discovered as far as the wood - yes, just wood.  Not even hardwood, let alone teak.  The footstools are rotting - proof positive that it's not teak.  We had a wood expert come and look at them; he confirmed the wood isn't even hardwood, let alone the teak we paid for.  Perhaps the furniture in the showroom is teak; the product we received is not.   I contacted Friendly Planet, and they said it's up to local guides where they take tourists.  So beware!   If you take the tour and stop at Chiangmai Sudaluck Company, just look - don't be suckered into wasting your hard earned $$ on junk.",0

In the end the sandwich was just 'ok' but the big reason they only got two stars was that they served canned baked beans and they weren't 'homemade' as they had stated - it's pretty easy to know when you taste a can of baked beans.

Every single month they reverse the charge to us but then bill us again the next month. They have our credit card, so I had to cancel our cards to stop the payments that they were double billing.

We walked away once we were informed and I won't be back. Also, they need to update their signs and website to reflect their change.

2655137,2,I use to like going to this facility. They are still a pretty good indoor shooting facility but I was trying to use the military discount and they were a little weird about it. I even had a few interesting comments about breaking my bank for using the military discount. If you go to the range every couple of days or so and purchase ammo at your location I wouldn't say things like that. I would say the staff needs training in customer service especially about not alienating your customs. I wished I didn't have to lower my rating for this place because I was starting to like this facility. But those to times I went in there I was made to feel like I don't rate a military discount and for that I will not come back to this place. Also I wasn't very sure if it was active duty military or veteran. Now it wasn't very specific. Anyways just disappointed in the situation. In the future there should a better way to handle that situation. I feel like the cashier did not handle it well. It just made me feel awkward and unappreciated. Also by no means do I want a hand out but I usually ask for military discounts. Especially if they post it on a sign because I am a veteran. Well thanks for reading my review I hope this helps.,0
1992494,1,"AVOID DURING COVID!!!  Made a reservation to celebrate my 50th birthday at Creeds with my wife and son.  Booked the reservation thru the reservation app that they use.  I then called to request a. Inside table.  I was told they could not guarantee it, but would do their best to accommodate my request.

We arrived to a packed parking lot.  More packed than I've ever seen it.  Waited in line to get to the Maitre D.  Finally got to him and was told they had no inside seating; just outside.  I referenced that I had called and requested inside. He said they had nothing. I asked how long for an inside table and was told it wasn't going to happen.  With it being a Saturday night, we obliged to sitting outdoors in their tent. They seated us at the first table right where everybody walks in and out. We sat there for two minutes, watched 20 people walked past us and listen to the loud noise from Route 422. We finally got up and left.

Thankfully, another restaurant down the street was able to accommodate us last minute and the birthday celebration was salvaged!

4781464,2,"I went in for an xray. They never told the radiologists I was there after they checked me in so I waited 45 mins and then asked how much longer. 15 mins after that they took me in. They didn't have a doctor to read the results so they said they would fax the results first thing in the morning to my doctor's office. 

It was a week until I could get an appointment and when the doctor came in, he saw that the hospital never sent over the results, so he tried calling but no one answered. He came in and said that I had to drive back to the hospital to pick up the results myself, which is ridiculous.

I called ahead and only got voicemail at the radiology department. I called the front desk and they said they always put people directly in voicemail, sooo I had the nice lady at the front desk call multiple people to find it.  After waiting a while, someone who isn't directly related to this job function brought it out to me. 

I would not come here again for tests... they didn't explain the results while I was there, give me a copy of the CD or send it to my doctor, and they barely had their act together to hand me the results when I came in to pick it up.

I was told by my doctor's office that they would call me right away if something was wrong or broken when they received the results so it could be treated. This hospital, and my doctor's lack of basic administrative communication could have postponed immediately needed treatment, potentially leading to further injury.",0
3298758,2,"I gave myself a cooling off period, as I was ready to give a one star rating several hours ago.  Feel like giving this business two stars is being generous.

Let's start with the positives.  Capriotti's makes terrific sandwiches.  I have never had a bad sandwich at Capriotti's.  They use top quality ingredients and the preparation of the food is always excellent.

With this particular location, I have experienced several customer service related issues.  When the head manager is there, he is always super friendly, helpful and professional.  When he isn't, they leave this lady in charge and let's just say she has the personality of a dead fish.

Today was the last straw.  I waited for twenty minutes after ordering my sandwich, in their non-air conditioned facility.  Then when I politely went to ask if my sandwich was ready, this lady looks around and grabs my sandwich which had been sitting around.  As politely as I could, I told her it would have been nice if she would have let me know my sandwich was ready.  She then proceeded to throw the sandwich I ordered in my general direction, in an aggressive manner.

I don't mind paying the higher prices for Capriotti's products as I feel they are high quality.  I will not stand for crappy customer service on top of high priced menu items.  Someone needs to sit down with this lady and talk to her about her poor attitude.  I have experienced her unfriendly vibe and overall poor customer service skills far too often when I go into this particular location.  Won't be going back because of it.",0

5824004,1,"We were out in Philly for my birthday, and after dinner, we decided we wanted to find a hookah bar, and hang out. We did our due diligence on google, and saw that Infusion Lounge was close enough to walk to, and didn't have terrible reviews. 

When we got there, all the men we were with were charged $10 cover, and ladies got in for free. My friends went to the bar to get a soda, and three drinks, which ended up costing $42, and the drinks barely had any alcohol in them. We were told that we would have to wait for a table if we didn't want to go into the VIP area for bottle service. Then when a table finally did open up, they told it was going to be $150 for the table, but that we shouldn't have a hard time getting there with 7 people, and two drinks per person, and two hookahs. My entire party was mortified. We had already spent over $80 getting into the lounge and getting 3 drinks and a soda, and now they wanted us to spend another $150. We asked the waitress what we could do if we just wanted to pay for the hookah, and she informed us that all 7 of us could try and cram around the bar. 

I know that I don't live in Philly, but even when we go to hookah bars in other larger towns (West Chester, Collegeville, Ardmore/Bryn Mawr), they don't require you to pay for a table, unless its a VIP area. This place was a complete rip off. 

I really wanted to try and apply our drinks towards the table and stay since we had already spent $80, but they wouldn't let us do that, so we left. 

It was really loud in there, which I expected for the ""club-like"" environment, but it was almost impossible to get a drink at the bar, and the ""couch area"" they were trying to seat us in, was not worth paying $150. I feel like I could have purchased that couch at a yard sale for less than that. The girls serving were also in corsets and booty shorts, which was interesting....They didn't look very comfortable, and whenever I saw them talk to the owner, it almost had a sort of Pimp-telling-his-tricks-what-to-do sort of feel to it. It was definitely shady. 

I will NEVER go back here- way too expensive. They shouldn't charge a cover in the first place, their drinks should have a bit more alcohol in them, and they definitely shouldn't charge $150 for a non-bottle-service table. This certainly was not the way I expected to end my birthday celebration after a great dinner out at another place.

Beware- you're going to spend a lot of money, and get completely ripped off. I'd just as soon go buy my own hookah and invite friends back to my place.",0

Then we saw how desolate it was inside. After walking across an empty restaurant to the only section with people in it, my wife and I knew this was going to be a loser when we sat down. There was a funky smell in the air, and the server was not welcoming. Should have known better than to stay, but made the effort only to be disappointed in the end. This place tries so hard but falls so short on the food. Prime for one of those restaurant turnaround shows if you know what I mean. Bread made it a very generous two stars because it was the only unique thing about this place which was actually a) good and b) succeeded in execution of flavorful taste.

2013492,1,"I will go ahead and disclose right now that I work for a different bank as an assistant manager. If my tellers treated customers the way these tellers do, they would all be fired. Not even kidding. It's atrocious. 

I was wearing yoga pants, a hoodie, and a beanie when I came in, kind of bumming it, and the entire staff seemed very discriminatory, as if I couldn't possibly have valuable business. 

I had an account here when I was a kid, so I was in this day a few weeks ago to finally close it. The teller at the window told me, after I had waited in line for about 7 minutes, that I would have to see a banker to close an account (clear lack of lobby management - no one ever asked me what I was waiting for, or even thanked me for waiting for that matter). Ok, but how long would that take? She leaned back as if to look, then in a monotone voice said ""I do not know, you'll have to have a seat in the lobby."" No customers were at any banker desks. Way to work as a team to convey info to your customers - my tellers always know what's going on at the desks and how long to tell customers for a wait time. 

Anyway, instead of sitting in the lobby, I went and stood in front of the banker on the phone, who was clearly discussing her vacation plans and not working. People can hear. We are not stupid. I stood there for another few minutes before another lady, maybe a manager or something (sad if so) told me to have a seat again and she would come get me when she's finished. No! She is talking about her vacation plans!! Hang up the phone and help me! Another thing I would never tolerate in my branch. 

Finally another gentleman helped me, after seeing that no one else was helping and I was getting irritated. I believe he was the investment representative. At this point I had been in the branch for about 15-20 minutes to close an account with $0.75 in it. When he was finished with the paperwork, he sent me back up to the friggin teller window!! At my bank, the banker will go visit the teller and conclude your transaction at the desk. I went back up, waited in line another 5 to 7 minutes, and a different teller helped me, and said ""Woo, big money"" when she handed me my $0.75.

Been here a couple of times since it's near where we live. Location is great since it's in the heart of the city. But unfortunately this mall is not well maintained. Stores are very limited, and the entire mall is dreary. It lacks the vibe of cheerfulness, the feeling of how a mall should be, a place to unwind and shop your heart out.

Called the restaurant and THEY had an attitude with me like I wasn't suppose to complain. The owner/manager told me to drive all the way back and show it to him. REALLY who takes the time to call a restaurant and complain over an $8 meal if they are lying! Just like Pauline D. said the attitude of the staff is like I really don't need your business.

We proceeded to the bar and got two drinks, a burbon and seven and one of there specialty drinks(a turtle) the drinks. The bar bill was 19.00 right away wich didn't make me happy but hey it's a high class bar in Reno... Whatever I just shrugged it off..
So next we go back to the couches and wait for our table to open up. A girl and her boyfriend came on soon after and they were talking to the hostess for quite a while. Joking and fooling arroind. Obviously the hostess and the girl that just walked in were friends. 
Next thing I know a table opens up and low and behold who gets the table?? The hostesses friend. The hostess said ""your reservation is ready"" but it was pretty clear to me that there was no reservation both in the obvious friendly nature that wouldn't be portrayed by just another customer and a hostess. And by the way they joked and laughed for the ten mins prior to getting the table. 
then it happened again kinda, however a couple moved from the bar to OUR open table and the staff just let it happen. after which we finished our drinks and took our business elsewhere.

They never act on it there's never an out come.  They don't care so why would employees care how they do their job.  I should say a Lack of doing their job.  Modern era of security cameras a wonderful thing to catch my delivery postal worker person not walking up to my front door to ring bell or knock on door so I can sign for the package I have been waiting for all day to be delivered.  Amazing how they just don't care about your mail.  How important some packages truly are.  I have it on my security cams that mine couldn't be bothered to come to my door.  But took time to fill out form stating I wasn't there to sign for package.  Sat at my mailbox filling and signing that form which is a lie.  Stuck it on my mail at mailbox, not at my door in the mailbox.  I have proof never attempted to walk to my door I have proof I was there.  The manager at this Largo Post Office an older lady who truly doesn't not care and from what I understand that she knows they do it and does nothing about it.  Oh well you can drive to post office next day to get it. So not only do I have to be at my home all day but be around next day which happened to be a Saturday to go get my package they failed to deliver.  She did not want my name or address to see what employee was assigned to delivering my mail that day.  She did not care that I could show on my phone the footage from my cameras from front of my house that the person NEVER got out of their truck!  It's disgusting when someone goes out of their way to do a wrong thing then sign their name to that lie and nothing gets done.  I sent a formal complaint to the post master generals office in DC I truly hope they address this issue.  This isn't first time with this problem but it's first time I can prove it.  If you can't trust them then they do not deserve to have that job.  The world is a bad place now with alarming amounts of people who just don't care about right and wrong.  I didn't deserve this I did nothing but waited by my front door for a very important package to arrive.

We ordered, what was supposed to be free hot sake with all you can eat, twice, and never got any. The server didn't seem to know anything about the sushi, or how to treat a customer. We were charged the customary 18% gratuity, which I've never had an issue with before, any where I've ever been. But these guys didn't deserve a dime. And we were not there on a busy night, so they had no excuse. One of our party only wanted one specific type of sushi, and had to wait over an hour to get it. By then the rest of us were just about done eating. The food itself was decent, but nothing special. I'd highly recommend going to almost any other sushi place in the reno area! This place has gone severely down hill in the past year or so. I will never be returning here, especially with so many other quality sushi places in the area.

6174546,1,"Unfortunately I didn't have the best experience. I tried ignoring all the warning signs that my kid wasn't being acknowledged there. First I never got communication at all on how my kid was doing. I always had to ask and the teacher always seemed annoyed or stressed. I believe that we should at least get weekly updates on our kids and I never got anything unless I asked. And all the information wasn't useful or personal. It didn't seem like they were getting to know my kid. Also, they said they would make a Facebook page and post pictures of what they do in class because I complained. That never happened either. 

Then if my kid was absent they never called to ask why he wasn't coming in that day. One day he came home with scratch marks on his neck from another kid, it was legit claw marks. They didn't tell me anything until I asked. They tried to ignore it. 

My kid was there for 4 months twice a week for 4 hours and the week of parent teacher conferences the teacher said she just found out my kid could talk and was shocked. How convenient that the week of parent teacher conferences they decided to get to know my kid and found out he can talk, know his colors and shapes. They just got to know him probably because they needed to give me information on him. They tried making excuses that he doesn't go to school that often or maybe he decided to join the group activity that week. I don't believe that is true.

533574,1,"Honestly, I haven't had such a poor experience in quite some time. My car was with. Blossom for 4 weeks when the original estimate was 1. 

Communication is horrible. I regularly had to facilitate my car being repaired correctly within the guidelines of State Farm. Including helping Blossom understand why may car was at their repair shop three times. 

My car sat on Blossoms lot for the first week without any progress because of miscommunication between the service shop and the body shop. 

I would receive contradicting reports regarding the status of my car. At one point 2.5 weeks in I received an email stating my car was ready. Knowing better I contacted Blossom to confirm my car was ready. I was told by service it was indeed ready including a final balance owed. I arrived at the service center as was told to go back to the body shop. I arrived at the body shop and I was told they already delivered my car back to service. After waiting 45 min I was told by the body shop manager, Lori, that they were sorry they looked so 'retarded' and they continue to tried to find out the status of my car. As it turned out my car was not finished and they were still waiting on parts. 

I tried reaching out to the General Manager and never recieved a response.  I would be told by employees they would call me back and a return call NEVER came. 

The capstone of my experience ended when I arrived to the body shop today to pickup my car. It took 30 min for my car to be moved to the delivery area. I have a Chevy Volt. Once it arrived I was told by their Body Shop rep Joe, 'I'm not very familiar with your car. Your percentages are low. Will you be able to get home?'  There was 2% battery left.  I told him I'd make it as it has a gas generator. My usual experience has been the dealership knows the model of my car and charges it before delivery back to me.

A month later i get surprised with a bill mailed to me saying i have to pay $833.54 because i didn't hand in the keys and because the apartment had some trash bags. The apartment was left clean and empty! After i contacted them they claimed that they contacted me several times but there was no answer, and they claimed that they emailed me as well.

The last time I went will be my last time going ever. I had a bad experience. Since the beginning the woman didn't look happy when she saw all my hair and she refused to cut my hair the way I wanted it. She stated ""my hair type couldn't have layers!"" I already had layers and was shocked that she didn't want to do her job as the employee. So I told her maybe she shouldn't cut my hair if she didn't feel confident in giving me the style I wanted. When I said that,she got really upset and started yelling at me saying I was harassing her. I was so embarrassed all the employees and customers started looking at me and I called over another employee. She looked scared and didn't want to tell me the name of the worker who was discriminating me. I was pretty upset how the whole situation turned out. It was saddening that this was one of my favorite places to get my hair cut in the past and they didn't want to cut my hair. Never going back!",0
5553304,1,"I've been going here, hesitantly, for over a year.   The vet is old school and has spent more time at visits trying to convince me to take hog medicine to prevent Covid than talking to me about my pets.   Went there yesterday with my 65lb 8 month old puppy as he was vomiting all day.   While we were getting lectured over and over ""If you give him toys, you're killing him, you may have killed him"" seriously nonstop.   Before we knew what happened he shoved bb's, metal like from a BB gun, down our puppy's throat.  Told us to take him home and come back in the morning if he wasn't better and he would X-ray to see if the BB's had moved through his colon.  He said if he ate a toy and had an obstruction that he had a 50% chance of living.   We went home for about an hour before realizing we had to do something else.   Took our puppy to an emergency vet in St. Louis who said the bb trick is from the 70s and not necessary.   They could do an X-ray and tell if there was a foreign body inside our puppy.   They did the X-ray and our puppy needed surgery.   We were told the surgery has a 95% success rate unless the damage is bad and they have to remove some intestine, then success drops to 85%.   Both still better than the 50% we were told at our previous vet.  The surgery went great he is recovering and they said had we waited until morning things would have been much worse.   I'm so glad that our instincts told us to get him emergency care!!  And, it was a dishcloth that he ate, not a deadly toy. I wish that I could give zero stars.",0
4274462,1,"Airport does not offer free wifi, which I have thought for awhile is just an annoyance.  I refuse to pay $8 for one hour of internet.  So I read instead.  And my daughter cannot afford to pay this and would never pay this.
After last week's storms and flight cancellations, Jan 2, 2013, I discovered this is much worse than an annoyance.  I blame Southwest who has a hub there for not putting more pressure on the airport to get out of the stone age and not be so cheap.  Lines were football fields long with people trying to see an agent to get rebooked.  I used my phone but I am 60 years old and am used  to using a phone to make reservations.  Most people use the internet now...and many simply cannot afford to pay for internet access.  At the very least, this airport should have offered free access during times of severe weather and flight cancellations.  I had no way to find a hotel to stay in while I waited in line for the agent....I eventually just used my phone to pick any hotel, no comparisons available (I do not have a smartphone but use my ipad for these things generally) and could not understand how little the airport cares about the thousands of people stranded there.
Cheap.  Short signted.  They will change but we all have to suffer until they get there.
I have logged my complaint with Southwest airlines already.  However, I am unable to complaint to the airport because their website isn't working and no one answers the phone.  Surprise?!?  I think not.",0

6849445,1,"I truly wish I could give this establishment less than 1 star. This was the most unprofessional and unpleasant 2-month long sales experience I have ever had with a business. I inquired about purchasing a used Tiguan, spent hours and hours on end with the sales and finance team, finally signed my papers, but was not given a vehicle due to a recall. I understood that the sales team and Chapman could not do anything about a manufacturer recall,  so I patiently waited until the car was certified and ready. The dealership offered me a similar car for purchase, which I was happy to buy instead of the first Tiguan. I made sure to ask whether there was a recall on this vehicle, and the salesperson ensured me that there was NO recall. I signed the papers and still was not given a car DUE TO A RECALL. At this point, I had already been waiting a month since my first appointment with the sales team, so I had no problem waiting a few weeks for this car to be done. Meanwhile, I received threatening and rude texts from the salesperson every time I inquired about the status of my car, which was extremely off-putting and unprofessional. A few weeks went by as I waited for my car to be done, and there was radio silence from Chapman. I decided to call, since I was not getting any updates on my vehicle via text, and the establishment had voided my contract without telling me. I ended up with no car and I wasted 2 months trying to work with the team at Chapman. Most of my in-person experiences were unprofessional, with the salesperson getting angry and yelling at me, taking off their mask, and making myself and my family feel uncomfortable. I gave Chapman many chances to make this right and they simply chose not to. Avoid this dealership at all costs unless you want to be harassed, lied to, and disappointed.",0

Definitely overpriced.,0

The crêpe was quite bad, with potatoes, dumped on too, as the sole representative of the ""seasonal vegetables"" with which the menu claimed it would be filled. The waiter actually forgot my companion's order entirely. I wonder what they thought was happening when they put down only one order for a table with two people. This total disconnection was the hallmark of our meal in nearly every sense. When we had to approach another member of the wait staff to ask again for my companion's order, it was eventually simply plunked down on the table without apology or acknowledgement of the delay. Equally bizarrely, there is no signage indicating where the restrooms are. I had to stand outside the kitchen door waiting for any staff member to emerge. After waiting for a while, I was told something garbled that didn't make sense and so so opted to wander outside the restaurant into a walkway/ hallway. After exploring, I eventually discovered that the restroom --the single toilet restroom - - was across the lobby inside a hotel. In other highlights, the restaurant has only whole milk and offers very few even remotely healthy options. Without the bizarre disconnection and indifference on the part of nearly every staff member (though and notable exceptions took the form of two male waiters), much could've been forgiven about this place, though not with a rating above three stars.",0

The room was dark (a floor lamp would help), there are no dressers so no where to unpack your clothes, the rack to hang things on was at about 7 Ft so I could not reach it and the pool is unheated and freezing cold. That was a huge disappointment because I would have loved to swim. My brother in law had a room too (he had a floor lamp). He swims daily and he tried to swim in the frigid water.

2669557,1,"I'm not even sure where to begin this one. We got drinks okay but after that it went downhill. It took about 15-20 minutes for our apps to show up, and we got the following:

Poke Nachos: Imagine an entire plate of nachos with maybe 10 pieces of fish on them, not worth it. Weird concept.
Kung Pao Sprouts: Not cooked enough, no color to them at all but the sauce was nice and spicy.

We then waited a half an hour to get our entrees which were a salad, burger, and wings. I think our server must have forgotten about our food then tried to have the cooks re-fire all of it. 

Truffle burger: She never asked us how we wanted it cooked but burnt to a crisp on the outside and WHITE on the inside was not acceptable. The bun was also burnt. The fries were the best part about this and they weren't even hot.
Beet salad: Super soggy like it had been sitting out for a half hour, beets were canned beets cut up it seemed. We sent this back.
Wings: These were soggy on one side and burnt on the other, like they sat out and to heat them up they were thrown in a pan but not moved around at all. We also sent these back.

So after sending back half of our food, we asked for the check. You think they'd want to get us out of there but no. It took another 10 minutes to get our check and get out of there.

I think this place is new but they have a ton of kinks to work out. They gave us poker chip coupons to come back and try again. Definitely not planning on it.",0

When I got home I noticed that the original stains were still there! I called GC immediately. The woman (she wears glasses, which I'm pointing out as I do not know her name) acknowledged that they knew the stains were still there and said they tried to clean it. How about calling me if you couldn't remove the stain or telling me when I picked the item up instead of taking my money?? I asked if they would reclean the items or refund me. She said no. She started to argue with me  and said she would call me back. She called me about 15 minutes later and said they would give me $50. No. I want the item cleaned or a full refund.

She came by behind the bar and out of being irritable with her customers she started swearing. Are you serious?? I was in shock!

4561609,2,"Food allergy peeps and vegans beware: Nirvana does not do customizations. This was the most inflexible Indian place I've ever been to. Nearly all veggie dishes contain dairy, and they cannot be made without since their bases are premade with cream and/or yogurt. I've actually never heard of this, as the base is usually a paste comprised of tomato, onions, spices, and sometimes cashews. Makes me wonder if it is not only the bases but the curries themselves that have already been assembled. And there was not a single non-dairy entree at the buffet.

I was seriously disappointed by the options presented; I tried to order off the menu, but every time I suggested something, I was told it was made with cream. And I couldn't just walk out, not after I'd practically dragged my friend across the city to eat some Indian (we'd already dropped quite a bit on Ubers). In the end, I said f*ck it, took my chances, and chose the buffet. To this day I regret it. 

The cream-filled curries I tried weren't worth the eventual price I paid; they were thin and tasteless, and an unnervingly low temperature leading me to worry about their overall safety. It wasn't expensive, but it was seriously unsatisfying. The only parts I enjoyed were the naan, chutneys, and pakoras, all of which were reasonably fresh. I ended up with a croupy and painfully sore throat that night thanks to my idiotic decision. 

The staff were friendly enough, but their uncompromising attitude is not one that appeals to me, and I won't be returning.",0

I was with someone else and I did not want my half-made sandwich and their poor service to ruin my lunch meeting. She did not respond properly or correct the situation, even though, it was the kitchen staff's problem. I should have only been charged 50% of the price because it only had half the ingredients.

How am I supposed to trust this person with my pet if they can't keep a commitment to me or even reach out to me to tell me that they're not keeping the commitment?

I asked a friend who lives in the suburbs to watch my pet, as that was my only real fallback option, but it's a huge imposition for her and should not have been necessary.

That is an accident waiting to happen with not only sweat making floor slippery but with us ladies overheating to the point of feeling ill.

The Saladworks person didn't know, asked someone in the back and looked at the shelves for a second without touching anything and came back and said he doesn't know. I asked if he knew how to check (you simply look at the ingredients and it will either say ""pasteurized"" or not). He said, ""Um well we threw the feta bucket away."" Okay...

First, if you are getting a generic drug, as them to compare the retail value against your insurance price.  Most pharmacies have a savings card program - $9.99 for 30 day and $15.99 for 90 days.  Only one pharmacist was happy to do this, every other time they look at you like your nuts.  I don't know why 90 day supply of this medicine costs 50.00 through my insurance, but I'd rather pay $15.99.

Second, if they say they will order something for you and give you the prescription back, go somewhere else.  They won't order it and when you go back they say they don't carry it.

Then I sat at the table, and I sat, and I sat.  40 minutes and no food.  7:48 placed my order and 8:30 no food.  Really 40 minutes.  Well finally he threw yes threw my husband and son's food and nothing for me.  After throwing our food on the table he said nothing and left us no time to ask where my food was.  Well I had enough !! I went up to the front to get my money back.  I asked a girl for my money back and asked to speak to the manager and she told me he was busy and walked away.  About 5 minutes later someone else came up to me and gave me my money back.  Oh and my husband's steak was so overcooked it was crunchy and the consistency of Beef Jerky.  I guess if I had never been there 1000 times I might not have known  what inferior quality of food I received.  How sad.  To lose such a long time customer.

2637246,2,"Terrible experience. Ordered 2 breakfast platters take out delivery. Both had 2 over-easy eggs in them. One showed up just fine, all in tact. The other looked like it was prepared as a joke -- a pile of egg white, with a puddle of extremely liquid and runny (as in not even cooked) cold egg yolk running all through the box. Either *both* yolks were mysteriously decimated on the way (no signs of damage to the box), or they were put in there that way, either out of complete ineptitude or some sort of resentment toward the delivery service. I contacted the restaurant about it, and was simply told they are not going to do anything and to take it up with the delivery service. Further, sausage was extremely bland, bacon was basic. Only giving 2 stars because the biscuit and grits were good.",0

I don't need to be a mechanic to know when I'm being bullshitted. They could not tell that my bearings were about to go out completely.

1835217,1,"Oh man, where do I start.  How about with the service?

The first thing you need to know is that there are two menus, one for food, with a limited selection of cocktails, and a longer booze-only menu.  Our waiter never brought us the longer menu, and when I eventually tracked one down and tried to order a cocktail off it, our waiter had no idea what that cocktail was.  He recommended the ginger cocktail without asking us what we liked, which would have been fine except that no one in my group liked sweet drinks.  The ginger cocktail tastes like tang with vanilla.  Seriously.  For a group of people who just want a dry cocktail.  He didn't know what was on the cheese plate, and never found out.  ""I think it's the dill...?""  We enjoyed imagining a conceptual cheese plate -- large pile of dill, tiny fork for eating it, shot of salted milk -- but not as much as we would have enjoyed knowing what was on the cheese plate.

We didn't get silverware until after our food arrived.  We never got ketchup.  He brought us the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  Our second round of cocktails took at least 10 minutes to get there.  He wasn't rude, but it was genuinely bad service.

And the food.  There's only one thing you have to do right with fries: make them to order so you can serve them hot.  Naturally, the fries were cold and a little stale.  The cocktails were much, much too sweet, except for the July mystery cocktail, which tasted very slightly like soap.  (To be fair, St. Germain always tastes a little like soap.)  The salad was profoundly mediocre: slightly aged lettuce, cucumber slices that had been sitting out for several hours, a sour tomato.  The kobe beef sandwich was pretty good, and the actual pieces of fried cod were ok, though the 'chips' were the afore-mentioned cold stale fries.

The worst, though, were the clams.  We got most of the way through a bowl of clams only to discover that they were slightly gritty because there was AN ENTIRE CLAM FULL OF MUD at the bottom.   And here we return to the service: waiter dude took the clams back, showed them to the manager, apologized, and took them off the bill.  Which is fine, and definitely meets the minimum requirements.  But I've worked high-end service jobs and here's the thing: if you care a lot about service, when something like that happens you try to make it up to the customer.   You send out a complimentary order of something (sweet potato fries!  doesn't have to involve expensive ingredients) or take a cocktail or two off the bill or offer a free dessert on the house.  

Nope.

When I asked  him if he was sure this would fix the problem he instantly copped an attitude and told me that this was where we would have to start and go from there. I could tell that he did not like me questioning his diagnosis and he assumed I was just some dumbass that didn't understand automotive mechanics.

At this point I get very uncomfortable and was concerned that I would be writing a blank check for God knows how much money so I opted to get a second opinion.

When we picked up the van and paid for the diagnostic, the manager refused to write down the results of that diagnostic on the receipt. He stated that he verbally told me what needed to be done and would not write it on the receipt.

I took the van to another shop in town and they diagnosed a bad fuel filter. They replaced the fuel filter and it passed emissions and has been on the road trouble free for several weeks. 

I think that the customer service aspect needs improvement and that the management there should be more focused on ""accurately"" diagnosing vehicle problems since that's what they're name says rather than jumping to expensive conclusions which is why I went there in the first place. 

I've attached the receipt they gave me and you can see there is no mention of what they actually diagnosed.",0

Reedmantoll of Springfield was the worst costumer care experience of my life! Here's why:

1. Took 41 days to get my car back!!!!

2. They tried charging me even though I was covered under warranty. 

3. Didn't offer me a loaner vehicle until 3 weeks in. 

4. Didn't start working on my car until a month in. 

5. Here's some excuses they gave me: some of the technicians aren't back from the holiday(Labor Day), technician is running late today, technician just got let go, technician is on vacation... again, warranty didn't go through, parts got lost in transit, were backed up doing oil changes this week. These are all real excuses they gave me. 

6. Said my car would be done ""next week"" 3 different times. 

7. I started calling and emailing executives of the company. Jim Hughs, Mark McTamney and Beth Stanton. Never heard a word back from any of them. 

8. When I finally picked up my car I heard the guys on the phone giving other costumers the same exact excuses that they had given me.
 
9. My car was a mess after getting it back. My spare tire was taken out from the trunk and not put back. 

10. I took it in with a noise in the transfer case and now my trans in slipping from park to drive and reverse. 

11. And just to top this off, I had an unopened container of peppermint gum in my driver side door slot, it was opened and half gone. 

This is all true. I've never been more pissed off with a company in my life. I'd rather drive it off a cliff than take it to another reedmantoll.",0

We were looking to see if this place could be a reception for our wedding, and the area is elegant and classy.  The service was less than polished.

The four of us ordered off the 3 course tasting menu.  The bisque served was very good, but it was pretty much downhill from there.  There are plenty of other places that serve just as good a bisque anyway.

The ""mojito ceviche"" was pretty tasteless beyond some mint.  The main courses didn't offer anything memorably welcome either.  A pork tenderloin served with a seared pork belly yielded hunks of fat with a ridiculously unchewable seared side with unimpressive sliced tenderloin.  The fiance ordered the roast chicken expecting some dark meat only to find that it was all white.  I'm a fan of white meat but it was pretty dry.  

I ordered the shrimp with grits that came with a stuffed trotter (I could have sworn it was snout, but anyways...) and the shrimp and grits didn't offer much of anything.  The trotter, which was nicely crispy on the outside with some fat, but the inside stuffing was some five-spice flavored lean ground pork.  I wonder if the chef had the intention of the fat in the trotter to moisten up the pork (Have had such a trotter stuffed with sticky rice and pork before... that rocked.) but it definitely didn't work out.

I'm getting the impression that this place is trying to bring the ""farmer food"" with some ""elegant flare"" but this place just made me leaving pretty pissed off.  Beyond the great atmosphere, An American Place served up little else.",0

We sent them pictures weeks ago and they finally got back to us last week about coming to look at some things they said theu were interested in.  I looked at their facebook page, and while it didnt exactly have the kind of things my friends and family and I like, they seemed nice and genuine and wanted to give it a shot.  We get new things almost daily and try to refinish and paint(if needed) as quickly as possible while still working regular jobs. After rescheduling a few times (totally fine), they came this afternoon while I was at work and met with my boyfriend.
  The son and the mother came and they were short and rude the entire time. They threw blankrts on the floor and barely looked at anything or spoke. We live in Old NE and it isn't the ghettos of Calcutta like the woman seemed to believe. She wouldn't go in the garage or the patio and was extremely short. They didn't know any furniture designers or what pieces were called. Just a bad experience that left my boyfriend feeling like he did something wrong. He thanked them (despite them completely wasting his time after knowing what they were going for) and neither said a thing. Bad day maybe? I hope so. The least they could do would be to say thank you.

6443597,2,"The only reason for the second star is because of the first time I ate at Deaver's.  They pulled me in with crispy flavorful chicken wings and juicy seasoned chicken kabobs.  Every other time since the first time has been a huge disappointment.  I think it's kind of sad considering this has been a well known local establishment that seems to have just gone downhill.  

First off, the service sucks.  The waitstaff try to appear ""that good"" by ""remembering"" your order instead of writing it down.  That's fine until they come back 3+ times to ask you again what/how you wanted.  

Things I've had here:

Chicken wings - good once, but like I said, not good ever again.  
Philly Cheesesteak - dry beef, half cooked peppers and onions, little cheese
Chicken kabobs - good once, dry as dust the next time
Reuben - burnt, even the sauerkraut and beef on the inside.  How does that even happen?
Pizza - probably the worst.  Hardly any cheese and the crust seems almost stale (and no...I'm not some out-of-towner bagging on St. Louis style pizza)

I like the ranch dressing.  Does that even count?

As the final kick in the junk, our table of two adults and one child was charged gratuity. HUGE PET PEEVE.  When I asked the manager if this was standard, I was told, ""well some servers do it, but I'll take it off if you want.""  By then the damage had been done.  I understand when it's a party of 10 people on the same bill, but two adults and a child?  Oh naw.

As someone who worked for tips for 12 years, I have a surprisingly different opinion of this than other people in the industry.   You take the good with the bad.  A tip is NOT an expected charge.  Tips are WORKED for.  It is a bonus for a job well done, or at the very least, mediocre.  I have never, nor will ever willingly tip less than 20% (which is where I start even with poor service), simply because that's how I roll.  That being said, if a gratuity of 10% or 15% is added to my bill, you're not getting a single penny more from me.",0

I can look past decor because I try not to judge a book by its cover but it was so stuck in the 70's! I can try to appreciate the charm but the food was subpar and I was disappointed.

Secondly the pizza was nothing to write home about. For $16.95 you'd expect lots of cheese, a nice hearty crust and good toppings. Sadly the pizza was super thin, hardly any cheese (which wasn't the best quality) and the pepperonis were scattered and not touching each other like other places. Oh and don't let me forget the mozzarella sticks...they were so soggy, tasted like old oil and had a weird after taste to them.

The Naan had almost zero garlic on it and the Mango Lassi tasted zesty, like tingling sensation you get when eating Kimchi.

You can tell that the problems start at the upper top management with Mark (general manager), Chris Williams (manager) Kristina (Director of Finance) that trickles down through the organization.  Were we not in the position, we would have walked away from the deal all together.  This review will be posted and a complaint with be filed with Honda!  For starters, we knew we needed to buy a commuter call for the long distance travel to and from work. We knew we wanted to the Honda Civic for the gas mileage. We asked to work with a newer sales person as we thought it would be an easy sale and give someone new an opportunity.  BIG MISTAKE!  We were given a kid name Michael who had no guidance and never any answers.  Even down to buying installation parts and simple things like mats. For example we had picked out the car and Michael told us in writing that he could have it shipped on June 13th, when I followed up with him on June 13th for pick-up his response was ""Did you want us to locate one as soon as possible?"" I had to resend his message to remind him of our conversation and point that the car should have been ordered already and picked-up today. In addition my husband wanted 3 additional installations and Michael came in at $600 over cost.  Note he said that was with his 20% discount. My husband called the service department and got a quote of $600 less than Michael's quote.  I wrote to Michael upon my husband's frustrations and asked to speak to a manager. Another manager called me directly and said that Michael had calculated it completely wrong and yes the price should be $600 less. Kristina who is very unprofessional yet the Director of Finance told me I had to apply online that night to get the promotional APR. Which I did and I received an instant approval.  Only to come back the next day and she changed her story that the deal had expired. I had to remind her what she wrote to me in text (had everything documented) that she told me that was why I had to apply that night. Come to find out, she couldn't get it approved so she would offer me $500 less of the sticker price which would make up the difference on the increase in the APR.  Fine.  Go to sign paperwork and there is no $500 less. She get's frustrated and call Chris Williams the manager who walks in and says I was told by my manager Mark this is the deal and if you don't like it then you need to leave. Meanwhile....Kristina has her computer screen up and open to see another applicants credit application showing name, address, annual income, mortgage and other such data which is a huge security breach.  Someone who is a finance would know that they should either close their screen or have it get the privacy screen. We were left at that point through all the horrible process with being told a lie and still needing to go through with the sale. So now we ask for the high wall mats, in which Kristina replies looks like Michael got one thing right, he got you the mats. We say great.  Awhile this is going on, the female reception and two older salesman are talking about ""Hookers"" in the front entrance way laughing away.  Very unprofessional. Sale is done we walk out the door get in the car and guess what??? Wrong mats. We have to go back into the dealership to tell them they put the wrong mats in the car. They tell us and write a receipt that they will overnight the mats to us. Fine, we leave it is Friday. We waited June 17-June 22nd no mats. I call the manager on Monday, June 24, 2019 and speak to Chris W again. I tell him to please refund my money at this time the mats were never received we will to dealership in Limerick. He says let me look into it and I will get back to you in 5. He calls me back and tells me they NEVER ordered the mats. Go Figure. Today I call to check on my refund for the mats, they refunded me $155 and not the $164.30 in change.  This dealership is absolutely horrible. Would never recommend them and will file an official complaint.",0
582573,2,"I have been coming to Sweet Soulfood since they first opened across the street in their older venue. Initially I was blown away by the flavors, variety and quickly growth. I'm so proud that you all have expanded. The new location is beautiful. Also I was a big fan of your vegan ice cream and can't wait until Soul Sweet vegan ice cream shop opens.

I got some takeout today and I just want to encourage you to not lose your quality. I got the Mac and cheese, fried cauliwings and soursoup ginger drink. The first two items were my fav treat to get from you all since the beginning!

Today the Mac and cheese was so sweet I couldn't even doctor it up with seasoning to taste better. The cauliwings were ok- but don't have the crisp and flavor that it use to have. It use to taste so good it was hard to detect it wasn't chicken! In the other hand - the drink was  delicious!

It's like I stuck a dog in the microwave.  There is no 'snap'.  The bun is quality, but I find it too dense for what is a fairly small sized wiener (ha!).  Chili was decent, toppings portion was just about right.  

I'd serve the dog on a flatter plate, the baskets they use make using a knife and fork problematic because of its high sides.  They give you a knife and fork to eat with.

Had a combo with a drink and garlic/Parmesan tater tots.  Total was nearly $11.50.  While the tater tot portion was huge, $11.50 is way too much money for that meal.  Go try the Lunchbox joint on longley/mccarran if want to see a good food value.  Don't think I'll be back.",0

We finally took a seat in the bar. It was another 20 minutes until we received waters, and after 45 minutes a waitress finally took our order. We all ordered salads, as we were afraid hot food would take too long.

Well, lo and behold, salads were just as difficult. We sat at this restaurant for almost 2 HOURS and never received food. We asked several waitresses for updates. No one ever refilled our water. The waitress kept saying, ""your order is up next"" but no food came out of the kitchen. The tables around us sat as empty handed as we did.

We finally had to leave because we were missing our seminar at the convention center. It was so disappointing. 2 hours wasted for a single glass of water.

Tonight, the gentleman who answered the phone said simply, ""yeah, we already stopped them already.  You can order take-out if you want.""  Obviously not the words I wanted to hear more than an hour prior to their supposed delivery shutoff time (1 AM).  Thanks alot, however, if takeout were an option I do believe I would have ordered that in the first place.  

Although I've been involved in a love affair with Hoshun's Tiger and Ichigo sushi rolls, I'm not too sure I'll revisit the place.  Repeatedly not being able to order delivery during their serviceable hours has left a taste in my mouth so sour even the thought Happy Hour there makes me shudder.

I almost went somewhere else for this reason alone but they had a female doctor and the other place did not.  

When the original rx failed to help, the instructions were from the doctor to call back in two days if it failed to work and then they will prescribe the other rx. I called this am as soon as they opened bc of the pain level and they said no problem and they would submit the script over. Three hours later, I called them to find out they did not and they tried to get me to come back into their office.  It was a new doctor and I assume he wanted another co pay and more of my insurance dollars. The same nonchalant nurse took my call, failed to show she even cared, lacked empathy and certainly didn't apologize fully knowing and not caring that I'm in pain.  She said it would be called in immediately.  I waited an hour and a half to call and the pharmacy said they haven't received any new scripts for me. I call back and they said the physician didn't feel comfortable because he wasn't the one who treated me and they pushed for me to come in again for another examination. Listen, whatever your process is your process, but why wouldn't anyone call me back to tell me?  I was in pain. They knew this too.  So I basically waited all day without help when they said they would three times. I left a very detailed voicemail on their office message and they still didn't call me. They filled my script after telling me I had to come in without letting me know.  I only knew bc of my pharmacy alert.  Classic unprofessional FL business.

When I asked about it, the lady who implied that she is the manager argued with me that they are in transition to a new menu which is still not available yet and so they are giving me a side instead of the soup.  

My friend ordered their roast turkey lunch, and when ordering he specifically asked if it is a real bird or turkey breast.  The answer came back from the kitchen that it is a whole roasted bird carved up.  When the dish arrived, it was sliced turkey breast.  Again, that manager-looking lady argued it is the same thing.  They agreed to replace it with another dish and my friend ordered a Rueben sandwich.  Guess what, no sauerkraut in the sandwich although it is listed on their menu.  I guess it is another item from their future menu.

1118438,2,"Heard a lot of great things about this place but left feeling underwhelmed. The food was ok- but not well balanced. The cocktails sounded like they would be super unique based on the ingredients but didn't taste very different from their more traditional counterparts. The presentation of the main dishes was stunning and well cooked but the portions were comically small. Overall the experience felt like something people imagine""fancy"" dining to be - a dimly room with tiny portions designed to look like art. It so feels crazy to spend $150+ on an average tasting dinner for two and leave feeling hungry.",0

4546048,2,"I am so disappointed!  I usually never write reviews but feel that I need to this time. I had anticipated trying Steelbach for a while now and it did not begin to live up the hype. The brunch menu was somewhat limited and very few gluten-free options. I decided on the Brassica and the egg whites were raw/runny even after I asked that they be cooked thoroughly (the Brussels sprouts and broccoli were tasty, though). My son asked for a medium rare burger and it came out well done. Both of my parents ordered steak and eggs and the meat was really undercooked and super tough. Their hash brown potatoes were cold. They had to send it all back and order something else off the menu. It was super loud in the restaurant. The decor is awesome (wood, metal, glass) but there is nothing to buffer the noise and it was hard to hear the person next to you. Maybe I just went to Steelbach on the wrong day and the kitchen was training newbies. Not sure if I will make the 35 minute drive to try them again.",0

3968582,2,"Pros:
- Great staff. Everyone I encountered was friendly, and the cleaning staff did a great job. 
- Great location. Most of the big tourist attractions are within a mile- an easy walk or bike ride away. 
- The conference/event space is nice. 
Cons:
- Slow elevators. Unimaginably slow. There are 11 elevators, yet almost every time we took one, it was a 5+ minute wait. We waited 10 min once before taking the stairs. Something about how they're timed or where they ""rest"" is way off. 
- Bad climate control. We stayed for 4 nights and were only able to get the room cool for one night. The whole hotel was muggy. 
- ONE microwave is available for guests, in the laundry room. The hotel is 24 stories, so you can imagine how that goes. The microwave was gross and there was often a line. 
- The mini fridge in the room froze everything, and there was no way to change the temperature. This would be less annoying if it weren't for the above mentioned microwave situation. 
- The bathrooms are really outdated. There's no fan or circulation, and the shower has low water pressure. 
Overall:
The folks working here are great, but they're dealing with crappy infrastructure. For a ""nice"" hotel, there were inconveniences all over the place. For what they charge, I would expect to be able to have a comfortably cooled room and to be able to heat up food without taking 4 flights of stairs each way and waiting in line for a microwave. Thankfully it was only 4 floors- it would easily be a 30 min ordeal for those having to take the elevator. I would definitely attend events here again but will get a room at a nearby hotel in the future.",0

1940815,1,"Pro TV came to my house approximately three months ago after I called them and told him that the green light was flashing on our Mitsubushi TV. They said it was the power board and they quoted me $460 to come out and install a new power board. The next day Mr. Stevenski and his son came and took the back of the TV apart called me while I was at my office and told me that there may be more problems than just the power board. He told me, ""I don't know what it's going to take the fix the TV but you have to trust me."" I told him to go ahead and fix the TV. When I got home he told me the TV was ""like brand-new"" and that they got it all straightened out. He charged me $600 for the power board alone. His bill was $1029 but he told me if I paid cash he would take the sales tax off. He also warranteed the parts and labor for 90 days but said that the TV should be good for a long time to come. Now three months later, just days before his 90 day guarantee would expire we now have the same problem. After several phone calls we got him to come to the house but he told us it may cost more to get the TV working and I told him that I did not want to hear it as the TV was under his warrantee. He changed out 7 resistors and told me that the parts were $200 and presented me with an invoice. I told him that if the TV was still working in 90 days he would get paid. He would just have to trust me as I trusted him in the first place. Later his wife called and she was quite rude on the phone. Also our cleaning lady was made very uncomfortable by him. She told us he was very foul mouthed while he sat on the couch watching his son do all the work. After he left I did a little research only to find out his $200 resistors were really only $3 each and the $600 power board was only $56. This guy is a rip-off from the word go.

2606528,1,"Frustrated

On a Friday afternoon, three days after having dropped off my vehicle to have a factory recall frame protective coating applied, I went to pick up my vehicle only to find the black protectant substance that was applied to my frame dripping off onto the parking lot.  I asked the service team what was done to my frame and why it was still dripping wet.  I was told that a thick gel was applied to my frame so it couldn't be dripping and it just looked wet.  I walked out to the truck and let a drip fall onto my finger to show to the staff.  I was initially met with looks of disbelief that quickly turned to an explanation of ""the weather is causing it, just don't wash it for 72 hours and it will be fine"".  I expressed my concern about driving in its current condition (concerned that sand/rocks/leaves/etc. would become stuck to the frame) but the staff offered no alternative.  

I then opened the door of my truck to find the interior covered with a white film.  Since my vehicle's interior had just been detailed 4 days prior to dropping it off for this service, I asked the staff if the paperwork they had given me included a free interior detailing.  When I showed the service staff my vehicle's interior I was told that it must have been that way when I dropped it off because there was no way that they could have done it.  The only support they could offer in response to any of my concerns was that I could call the service manager on Monday.  They did not offer to take any action themselves.  I left frustrated and wrote a negative review. 

The next morning I received a notification from an individual within company leadership asking me to contact them.  I responded, highlighting my concerns (the status of my frame being most important) and attached a video of the debris which had already adhered to my frame.  Their response stated that the dealership would redo the frame coating and detail my vehicle; furthermore the service manager would contact me on Monday to set up the appointments.  The call on Monday did happen, but the individual from the service department wanted to schedule a detailing only and had no knowledge of my frame issue.  

I visited the service manager in person that afternoon (3 days after picking up my vehicle) to address the frame issue.  Without offering to look at the vehicle he informed me that there was nothing unusual about my situation. In fact, I was informed that I would need to wait months for the frame to ""cure"".  Additionally, I was told that it would take weeks before it could withstand more than light water spray.  Furthermore, the service manager stated that he was unaware of any commitments made to address the frame issue so would have to address with company leadership.  

Two days later I received another e-mail from company leadership.  While that e-mail did offer to detail my interior, it questioned why I did not consider other sources for the white residue on the interior of my vehicle.  Specifically it attempted to blame the organization that completed my interior detailing 4 days prior to me dropping it off at Newbold Toyota.  Additionally, it stated that there had been an error in the earlier communication and they would only redo the frame spray if it was found to be improperly applied.  Finally it stated that they had requested a Toyota factory technical representative do a physical inspection of my vehicle.  

My e-mail response explained how all other sources for the status of the interior had been ruled out.  This was based on the status of my interior when I dropped it off, the timeline between detailing and dropping it off and the fact that when I dropped my vehicle off the service technician immediately rolled down the windows in my vehicle.  As far as my frame was concerned, I requested the name/contact info/ticket number of the Toyota factory technical representative that would be contacting me.  His reply indicated that he did not have that information but did provide me with contact information for Toyota customer service if I wanted to initiate follow-on actions myself.  

As it currently stands, I am minimizing use of my vehicle whenever possible to ensure that the frame does not pick up more debris than it already has.  I am obviously disappointed with the status of my vehicle and had I known the implications of this visit prior to dropping it off for service I would have never made the appointment.",0

5569537,2,"We held our very small wedding here, and were shocked to discover what we discussed with the salesperson did not happen. We were told that there was room in the Hunt Room for us to get married in front of the fireplace, with room for 3 tables for our 21 guests as well. When we arrived last night, the three tables were set up with one table flush against the fireplace. I found a staff person and said ""(Salesperson)  knew this was a wedding. We're supposed to be getting married in front of the fireplace."" We walked back to the room together and some staff person said to me"" Well you have 3 tables."" I again stated that we were told there was room for 3 tables. WE had to tell the  staff to move the tables back- no one on the staff thought to do it themselves. My guests had to wait in the hallway for all of this to take place. Then, I saw that my wedding cake had no flowers on it. I had sent the sales person a pic of a wedding cake and discussed flowers. A man said to me very nonchalantly, ""There are no flowers because there's a floral bill."" There's a floral bill?? Did anyone communicate to me there was a bill to be paid for flowers on the cake?  No! I told him we would be expecting a big discount for this ridiculous lack of communication among their staff and the inability of the Inn to carry out a simple wedding as we discussed with them.
    Later in the evening a woman told me the Inn was comping us for the cake. $200 off of that bill was not enough for what we went through. The community expects that the William Penn Inn can competently carry out a simple function like our wedding- it's unbelievable that they can't. I will not be recommending William Penn Inn to anyone, nor will we ever return there for any reason. They won't get away easily with us and our wedding being treated this way. The Inn got our money, but only negative publicity from now on. May I suggest that the Inn's staff fix these types of oversights and miscommunications ASAP?",0
2231878,2,"There really isnt anything special about this place. I've been here 3 times. The first time we walked in on a Saturday night. It was way too crowded so we walked back out. 

Unfortunately this place is engineered much like many other Rittenhouse bars: packing a bar, tiny lounge space, and eating area into a cramped narrow space. There isn't much space between the wall and the bar, so on especially crowded nights its damn near impossible to either get to the dining-turned into dance floor area or to the bar itself for a drink.

The second time i came here with a group of my lady friends. We got here early on friday. That's all explained in my previous post. I'll just recap with: the music was stellar. The DJ was killing it. And I would have been ready to lay down some moves if it wasn't for the brighter-than-necessary-for-trying-to-bust-some-moves-and-maybe-grind-up-on-some-dude lighting and the weird setup up of tables around the tiny dancefloor area. 

The third and hopefully last time I came here was for happy hour with my co-workers. I admit that the variety of rum is impressive. However, how do you run out of Hennessey? Luckily, I was able to get my drink free since they did in fact run out and couldn't give me a full serving, but really, how do you run out of Hennessey? At a fricken bar? Who does that?! 

The happy hour is worthwhile if you can get a seat at the bar or the front lounge area, otherwise don't bother. Because you can't get a table in the dining area without reservations and it's really awkward to stand in that area between the wall and bar, holding a drink and trying to converse with a co-worker or mack on a cutie. And if you come here but don't drink (like my co-worker) and thrive off of virgin drinks, this also isn't the place for you, since the bartenders were quite unhelpful with that. The food is also a bit too expensive for what it is. I ordered the crab cake appetizer for $12. Go grab food elsewhere. 

It's $3 for well drinks which is ok, but I gave up on bankers club back in college, so I'd say find a better place if you're looking for something other than rum.",0

6506768,1,"Unfortunately I need to knock off some stars from my previous review.  I recently stopped in for a gel manicure/gel pedicure. I stated what I wanted and paid up front. The price seemed a bit low but I thought maybe they were running a special. I got to the point in my pedicure where I realized they were about to give me a normal pedi (vs. the gel I'd asked for).  I explained this to the woman working on my nails and she acted confused, then annoyed.  She yelled out to another person who worked there, who yelled out to the guy who works the register.  Apparently this was a HUGE inconvenience to them. Then they actually made me put my flip flops on and go up to the counter - mid nail service - to pay the difference in price. They could have waited till I was done. It's not as if I was going to try to sneak out without paying the difference for the more expensive service. Clearly the man who works the register misunderstood what type of service I wanted, yet they acted like I had done something wrong and embarrassed me in front of the salon full of customers.

Normally you get a complimentary massage during your manicure. Everyone got one that day except for me. And the worst part is, my gel manicure started to peel and lift after a few days! What's the point of paying all that extra money for the gel if it's just going to peel off after a few days? At the rate they're going, it's only a matter of time before French Nail Bar closes (just like G Spa before them).

376305,2,"The only reason they get two stars is because the food was actually very good. We got two different breakfast sandwiches, some donuts and a coffee and it was all great. However, the customer service was absolutely horrible. First, when you pull through the drive through, the menu is barely lit up so I literally had to look online for the menu before I could order. Right from the get go the girl over the mic was rude. She had an attitude, kept interrupting us as we ordered, and rushed us, even though there was NO ONE behind us in line and I had to go out of my way to figure out what I even wanted to order. One part of my order was a Girl Scout cookie ice coffee, when I ordered it she goes ""hot or iced"" and I say iced, we get to the window, repeatedly say thank you as she hands us our food to which we got no response, just dirty looks, and then she hands us a hot coffee with cream and sugar. Which we did not order, not even close. I would understand if she got confused on the Girl Scout cookie part, and handed us an iced coffee but she literally gave us a hot coffee. When we told her about it she goes ""no I heard you guys say hot cofffee with sugar and cream"" instead of just apologizing and getting the right drink. I work as a waitress so I understand the food business and customer service and I understand it is frustrating sometimes, but we were overly nice to this girl and she was rude the entire time. We even apologized for having her remake the coffee and thanked her when she brought us the new one, and she didn't say a word back and just gave us a dirty look. Also, this was at like 5 in the morning on a weekday, so they were not busy so there's no excuse on that part either.",0
5179758,1,"Do not shop here. Poor customer service they do not honor the care plan.

Please see my email to the manager below. Waiting on corporate to contact me back


Per our telephone conversation this afternoon. Please forward this complaint to corporate and i will follow up with them via phone.



To whom this e-mail may concern.


I brought my engagement ring  (which was purchased in 2008 at the Media, Pa location which has been closed) and my wedding band  (which was purchased in 2011 at the Cherry Hill mall location) to get maintenance at the Springfield PA location as well as the Cherry Hill Mall location in New Jersey and was told i was unable to get any work done to my rings. I went to the Springfield location a few years back to get my wedding band fixed and re-dipped as the structure was cracked. I also ask for my engagement ring to be sent to get dipped and fixed the diamond that was cracked. I was told on several occasions that they could not locate the purchase. I told them it was purchased at the Media Mall in Media, Pa and they stated that stored closed and that was the reason why and i had to bring my receipt back. They should have had the records even if the stored closed. Neither location is close to my home so the distance was a problem. I did come back with my receipt and then they told me i needed the log that  showed i had an inspection done. Not every inspection i received was logged as some were done when i was casually at the mall shopping and stopped in. 

The issue yesterday at the Cherry hill mall was similar Allen told me there is nothing corporate can do and we will not fix your jewelry because you have not been logging inspections every six months. Littman jewelers would not do my inspections and continued to give me the run around because the store my husband originally bought the ring had been closed and they didn't have the records in the system.


This is very frustration and each employee at the store lack compassion and empathy for me as this has been going on for years. These are rings that i have to wear for the rest of my life that is a bond between wife and husband and has sentimental value. My husband proposed to me when i was sick. The ring has aged and  the gold is fading, and it damaged and a diamond needs repaired. 

Why would we pay for insurance and not be able to use it on both rings. Both rings have the lifetime loss damaged guarantee and the lifetime jewelry care plan that i have not been able to use.

I remember visiting the Springfield mall location with my husband a few years back to get the same work done and the manager told me i should wait as the ring wasn't that old and it would take long to get it back.

Please consider this a formal grievance complaint against Littmans Jewelers.

I look forward to hearing back from you and hope that i can go to the nearest location to get my rings repaired with exceptional customer service.

I am a customer that has bought rings, necklaces and earrings and have been treated very impolitely.",0

They gave me a price of $300 but failed to mention the wind mitigation was and extra $75 and the 4 point inspection was also another $75. Their good deal.... not so good. Then they missed 2 major electrical issues. My main circuit board (electrical box) doesn't turn off! HUGE fire issue. They told me part of my electric in the master bedroom was boarded off and didn't work so I hired an electrician and guess what... the light bulbs just needed changed.

Before my appointment I let the receptionist on the phone know about this change, and she instructed me to bring my Aetna card information to the appointment. I arrived 30 minutes early and gave the card information to the receptionist. After the appointment which was for a standard routine cleaning, I went to the front desk and the receptionist informed that I was all set and did not have to pay anything. 
After I left the appointment, I received a voice message that they did not accept my plan and that I would have to pay for the appointment out of pocket. I called back and asked why this wasn't explained to me before the appointment since I had provided all the relevant information. I have never had this happen to me, at a dentist , optometrist, or doctor's office.

5593489,1,"You know the feeling when you really want to puke up but can't?  That's how I feel after just returning from Tavern 17.  Everything was terrible.  First we attempt to sit in a row of seats squished so they literally touch each other.  Then, the ""family style"" appetizers arrived, consisting of 3-5 pieces of fried stuff per every 8-10 people.  Some of us ate, others were left out.  Then we wait.  Then, the sauces for the appetizers came out, long after everyone had already finished the appetizers.  I am fairly sure they were store-bought and microwaved, but it didn't matter since we were done with the over-fried, cardboard-like appetizers.  Run out of the lovely luke-warm tap water that was already on the table before we arrived? Too bad!  We wait some more.  By the time we were getting ready to order a pizza to be delivered into the restaurant, we got our... BREAD!  This was, of course, after they took away our small plates, so there was nowhere to put our bread.  We wait some more.  And more.  Some people got their main dishes--the chicken (advertised as 1/2 chicken with pears and string potatoes) was different for everyone that ordered it, and resembled quail... though it wouldn't surprise me if it was pigeon. Uhh... I just almost threw up again. The vegetarians got panini sandwiches (normally a lunch food?), and others got dingy-looking salads that were wet and browning. We waited around, most of us left. Those that hung around got a ""dessert"", which was a pound cake from CVS with canned peaches on top and a spray of whipped cream.  They ran out of canned peaches and gave others an unidentifiable canned replacement fruit.  This cost $30.  Un-freaking-believable! I have NEVER had such a bad meal before.  Some people said this place has good happy hour sliders, but that is just not possible.  NOTHING good could have ever come out of the same kitchen.

We explained we had an order to be picked at 10am and she went to see if they were ready. This was after it's been paid for and we left a tip. She comes back and tells us it's not ready yet and can we come back in 10-15 minutes. It was highly an inconvenience but we agreed. We come back a half hour later and again weren't greeted.

Food was tasty , hot , and arrived in a timely manner , although a lot of the food was wrong and not what we ordered or how we ordered , the margarita was wrong  and not once did the waiter come to refill our drink . We had to flag down another waiter to help serve us , we asked for an extra side of cheese there was maybe a tablespoon of queso inside a white boat shaped dish , but they sure made sure they got the $3.00 on the bill for that!!

It was a miserable evening of dry, bland food that had a salad bar with no fresh vegetables other than tomatoes and lettuce.  Few condiments are provided with this meal.  Ice tea, lemonade and coffee are included.

I have never had such a miserably uncomfortable evening.  The chairs are the bare minimum and old.  I am an average sized person and was crammed in tightly up against the people next to me.

A lady nearby had a great deal of trouble maneuvering the stairs.  This place is NOT easily accessible for those with disabilities.

The production itself was poorly cast.  Mediocre at best.  Actors were older and not properly suited for the roles of a younger person.  The only exception to that being Courtney Cheatham & Lew hackleman.  At least 2 of the musical numbers were either poorly choreographed or dancers were incredibly out of sync with each other.

This evening was a real disappointment.  Management should fix up the venue and attempt to make the guests more comfortable.  I cannot recommend this place to anyone given the current condition.",0
2335461,1,"Let me begin by saying that I generally like Target., especially compared to that other chain that begins with a ""W."" And I won't even mention the one that starts with ""K""--they are no longer shopable.  
That being said, this is the worst Target I've ever shopped in.  It is small, poorly stocked, and both the cashiers and the patrons are--what's a nice way to put it--low class.  
Here's my latest experience.  No Gillette Mach3 Turbo blades whatsoever. I ended up buying Mach3 Sensitive Disposables, which were far cheaper than the Mach3 Cartridges.  Go figure--entire razors are cheaper than cartridges?  
No Charmin' Basic.  Seriously. No Basic. In a ""basics"" store?  But stacks and stacks of Mega Super Ultra Thick Ultra Soft.
But the topper is when I got home and realized there was no Charmin and no Mach 3 in my car.  Okay, the Charmin was a big package and I should have noticed in the parking lot, but the cashier just never put the razors in my bags.  Of course, I was charged for both.  
Perhaps if the cashier had spent more time taking care of my order than trying to get me to sign up for their ripoff ""Red Card"" credit card, I would have gotten my $25 worth of T.P. and razors.

2192487,2,"Update: I upgraded to a 4, now back down.  Total attitude again at the coffee bar, and I just think the menu and schedule is just off.  If you look to my first review it was a 3, and my favorite parts: coffee and baristas/coffee bartenders.  Since that first visit the norm has been the opposite with regard to service.

I just feel like a place with that much space, right in an amazing foot-traffic location, that can't figure out how to offer some hot sandwiches or some food other than a bagel or donut (donuts are not good) before 8 am on weekdays doesn't get the star (then minus 2 for horrible barista). 

The menu is small to begin with, how hard can it be to add some egg, meat, and cheese on a bagel to it?  How about some oatmeal with organic fruit.  Both could be made by a food truck, never mind a 4k sq ft. restaurant.

So back to the attitude and timing: 1) we go to get quinoa porridge and coffees at about 7:55 am on a weekday.  Sorry, no breakfast on a WEEKDAY until After 8. 2) The girl behind the counter was just really rude, made it seem like we were totally bothering her, and dismissive in delivery of said information. No help, no smiles, no sorry.  I just don't get who thought it would be smart to put this personality in a customer facing position.

Give your baristas some people training, expand the menu a little and get some breakfast food in the actual morning (I know 8 is actual morning, but I mean for adults) and I can offer support.

I want to this place so bad, but I just keep getting knocked down when I actually go.",0
508471,2,"My friend and I originally came here to attend a ""Ramen Off"" but after seeing that ""cheeseburger ramen"" was being served we decided to skip it and just eat at the restaurant. The event was held upstairs, and there were plenty of open tables on the dining room floor.

We got there at 5:10 and were put on the waitlist for the Ramen off. At around 5:25 we went up to the hostess stand (there were 3 hostesses) and asked if we could be taken off the list for the event and just dine in downstairs. The hostess asked us to hold on a ""moment"" and she would seat us. 20 minutes rolls by and it looks like she has no intention to seat us. I asked another hostess who said she couldn't seat us until the person who controlled the seating was back and she was currently on the phone. Again, at least half or more of the tables are open. Another 10-15 minutes till around and that second hostess seats us, in the back of the dining hall, without any apology or care we had to wait for over 30 minutes to sit. I also didn't understand why we were seated in the back when there were plenty of open tables in the front of the restaurant. 

Our service was decent but I felt like she was in a rush. I understand it might have been stressful because an event was taking place upstairs.

The cocktails are good depending on what you get, but I don't know if they're ""$14 good."" 

The food we ordered was the Tuna Tartare (it was excellent, and my favorite), the Shumai dumplings (my friend liked these, I didn't care for them), the hash browns (these were also very delicious and a nice spin on a traditional American food), and the spicy crab noodles (also pretty good).

All in all, the food is good, the restaurant is beautiful, but for me I appreciate an overall experience and if I feel like a burden to the staff I guarantee you I won't come back no matter how good the food can be. 

Also the heated toilet seats were nice...

714413,2,"This  review is for delivery. I ordered food through UberEats.

I ordered plain wings using the UberEats app. The food arrived on time. It was packaged in a plastic clamshell, and there was condensation on the top of the clamshell, so we knew opening up the food that the wings would be soggy. 

My husband pointed out that there was a sauce on the wings. As there was the option for ""plain"" wings, my assumption was that the wings would be undressed, as if there was a standard sauce, surely the option would have been ""house sauce,"" right? My husband took one bite of a wing, and he said it was soggy and that the sauce was disgusting, and he would not eat any more, even if I could fix the sogginess.

I put the wings in our air fryer, and that did help crisp the wings up. However, the wings were inedible. The sauce was spicy (good) but so salty that it was uncomfortable eating them (very bad). I tried a bite out of several wings to make sure I didn't just get one bad wing, but every one was extremely salty. 

We ended up throwing away more than half of the wings. Sorry, I'm not eating fried salt licks.

1550066,2,"I really wanted to like this place, but the experience underwhelming.  The beer was hit or miss, but are more moderately priced than better brewpubs: 
-Saison Brune was a terrible attempt at one of my favorite styles, far too thin of a mouthfeel and not particularly flavorful, head dissipated almost before it got my table, no discernible nose.  See Ommegang in NY for an excellent Saison
-IPA (rt. 113, i think) was good and hoppy, a little unbalanced, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
-Fox Track Brown Ale was a nice dark brew, great head and lacing on the glass, and had a very nice coffee aroma.

The food was acceptable, but nothing to write home about.  Nachos were gelled together by cheese that had been melted and then re-congealed long before making it to our table.  

The atmosphere was so confusing.  Senior citizens and 12 year olds abounded, making an odd mix for a brewpub.  TVs literally line the walls, but people weren't there to watch the games (I clapped for a phillies homerun and then felt awkward as no one else seemed to be aware there was even a game on).

The service was a bright spot.  The staff were all very nice.  Our waitress was great (although we received an incorrect entre, it was quickly fixed) and hit that balance of helpful, not overbearing.

The place is close to being a lot of fun, but overextends its beer list with styles it can't get right, has a weird Golden Corral demographic, and very average food.  With so many great local breweries (Victory, Yards, Troegs, Manayunk, etc.) this place has a lot of room for improvement.",0

1659867,1,"My initial review of Mariscos El Gato was from their Cherokee Street location. The chef and owner recently split and the chef has opened on Gravois in the Bevo Mill neighborhood. Better location and nice décor. I was there on a Thursday night with 2 other people. We got there about 7 and didn't leave until 8:45. It appeared to be the wife of the chef, a young girl, and a very young boy (perhaps their children) working the entire front of the house. The boy who waited on us was under 16 and his English wasn't the best and my Spanish is pretty rusty but he understood some of it. I ordered the Shrimp Momias (bacon wrapped shrimp.) The other orders were shrimp a la plancha (grilled) and a seafood plate of mussels, octopus, and one other item I forget. Also we ordered a guacamole appetizer and a couple of sodas. It became clear while we were waiting that everyone in the restaurant (almost full) was waiting. Tables who were getting served were getting partial orders and not everyone was able to eat together. We should have left but we didn't. We decided to wait it out because sometimes you become fascinated with what's going on around you and you can't look away. We never did see the guacamole appetizer. First out was the grilled shrimp. About 5 minutes later came my bacon wrapped shrimp. About 15-20 minutes after that came a plate of only mussels. The kid put in the order incorrectly on the ipad order taking system. My dining companion refused the plate of mussels because it was not what she ordered and demanded the check. The wife of the chef started arguing with her and did not want to remove the seafood plate or the guacamole from the bill. We all kind of had blank looks on our faces and said how are we expected to pay for something we never received?

I was told I had to have an appointment and show it on my cell phone in order to enter. I said I'm 77 years olds and I do not use cell phones. They said, ""You have to have a cell phone to show your appointment."" 
I then tried to hand them an application form in an addressed envelope to be sent to Carson DMV. I told them that the DMV website said a letter could be dropped off at any DMV office. They said the web site was wrong. 
What I saw were a lot of people standing outside in the cold wind, all sporting angry faces. A lot of money was spent with no benefit to the Public. Why can there only are one DMV in the fast growing Reno/Sparks area?",0
2756958,2,"This mini me 99 cents only store is one wacky tah-wacky 99 cents only store! The parking lot is just as small as the square footage and the first thing your eyes and nose are greeted with is their receiving dock. Receiving dock in the FRONT of a store? I guess when the ""back"" of your store, where typical receiving docks usually live, faces State Streetin Santa Barbara  and is a stone's throw to the ocean, well...all rules are flushed down the 99 cent only toilet. So this spectacle is a dirty smelly mess of exploded soda who's high fructose corn syrup has baked onto the sidewalk and produces this protruding smell typically smelled at the place you take your recycling if you choose not to have it picked up or not to hand over a bag of it to the homeless guy you see out on his daily collection route (GUILTY! Dude is tired of my Good Samaritan jesture of donating my recyclables to his cause cuz those kombucha bottles that get piled up in my car can get a little heavy)
After you get around that, you enter a narrow one door in and out walkway and then the maze of clutter. 
Wow just wow! 
Disarray of overstocked merchandise that really has nowhere to go. Kinda like In a big city where they run of land to expand so they start expanding vertically. There were sections of stock someone strategically maneuvered it vertically so that it fit and it didn't come crashing down on an unexpecting creature meandering down the aisle. 
The produce section is smashed In the back of the store, the part facing state street that Is all boarded up so entrance from state street is Impossible. Actually, the view from state street makes it almost unrecognizable to the untrained eye that this parcel of real estate houses a 99cent only store. Guess the powers that be don't wanna scare the tourists by displaying a 99 cent only store in this prime location of multimillion dollar Santa Barbara landscape. 
Oh and when you go to check out, there's these line forms here signs with hokey directions, and you have to leave your cart (or hand your basket to the cashier) on the side where the cashier stands (left) while you go to the right and go to the counter to pay for your stuff. I guess this is a theft deterrent practice. Hope it's working out for you. All it did for me, the honest shopper, was make me feel awkward.",0

4423851,1,"I've eaten at this particular BWW several times and have consistently had deplorable service. I'm talking waiters that straight up tell you the onion rings are frozen, waitresses that don't even take your drink order for 20 minutes even while walking back and forth past your table, bar tenders that go on break in the middle of your meal and leave you sitting at the bar with no service whatsoever. I'm talking about managers that address your complaint that you ordered your beer over 15 minutes ago, and your beer STILL takes another 10 minutes to come out (when you're sitting within spitting distance of the actual beer taps and could pour the damned thing yourself). This is the only place I've ever been to that will cut you off after 4 drinks and say it's ""policy"". The place is usually packed with disinterested staff that don't seem to be doing anything, including waiting on the customers. For a ""sports bar"" the place is always crawling with children and families, unless you sit in the bar area.

The food is nothing special. I only ever get boneless wings there, which aren't bad, and the large variety of sauces is fun. The selection of beer is boring and overpriced. I would encourage everybody to just order out rather than eat in the establishment...

...BUT! If you do order out, check to make sure that your order is correct before you get in the car and drive home, and leave them plenty of time to make your food if you need it by a particular time. I ordered a party platter of boneless wings for a super bowl party. I ordered at 1pm and was told the wings would be ready at 5:30. Now I understand super bowl sunday is a big day for a wing place and I expected it to be busy. But the place was a train wreck. Disorganized, chaotic, and full of unhappy-looking customers and staff. They had a few tables pushed together and covered with dozens of orders waiting for pick up. But... not mine. MINE was lost and delayed by 30 minutes, along with at least 3 other customers I saw there. And the icing on the cake was that when I got home, I found that they had given me the wrong wings.

Bottom line: you need to have the patience of a saint and very low expectations if you choose to eat here. If you meet those criteria, try to enjoy yourself. Try the Asian zing wings.",0

I was sitting at the bar so I was able to see most of the servers and bartenders. The place in terms of service is ice cold.

6475542,2,"Honestly, I've waxed all over the world since 2010 and this was one of the worst waxes I've ever had. I give two stars instead of one because I believe the girl that waxed me did what she thought was a good job.

I got a full leg, brazilian and under arm (It's what I get every time, everywhere).

During the wax, my skin was not pulled taught many times, the wax strip on my legs was usually pulled up and consequently not all the way off my skin numerous times. Despite any pain that may cause, the hairs aren't removed well that way so I was left with a number of stray hairs all over my legs. The wax also stays behind when you don't pull the strip quickly and closely to the skin so there was gobs of wax left on my legs.

The brazilian was much the same but with the hard wax. Skin was not pulled taught and so when the wax was attempted to be removed it often only came half off. Ouch! She went over and over the areas to the point I actually have a bruise and I usually don't get those. I still have way too much hair down there for all the fuss.

After she was finished with my legs and brazilian she left to let me dress on the bottom half. When I stood up there was so much wax all over my legs I actually stuck my head out the door and called her back to finish the job. During the process, there were still strips of hair not removed on my legs that I had her remove and I pulled off hard wax still attached to hair from the brazilian. She offered to rewax the brazilian but after all the waxing that had already been done I didn't want to put my skin through more.

This was also the very first time in my many years of regular waxing, that my feet were not included with the full leg wax. Sometimes I'm asked if I want them waxed and sometimes they just do it, but I was not asked and it was not done. By the time we got through all the other waxing and considering how sticky I still was I decided it wasn't worth the effort to ask to have my feet waxed.

To top it off, the painful process (not the most painful wax but definitely no where close to an easy one) lasted over 2 hours. Yes, that's right...over 2 hours. I get the same thing done every place I go world wide-full leg, brazilian, under arm-and the general time is 45 minutes. Sometimes it's around an hour and sometimes you're in and out in 35 minutes if they're speed demons. 45 minutes is a good general time frame. 2 hours + is absolutely NOT!

They do take the time to tweeze (with all the hair that was left from the poor waxing, tweezing would have taken several more hours), and that takes some extra time, granted.

Ellen is a sweet girl, but I would never ever go back nor would I send my friends there. I'm still sticky, and disgusted with the results.",0

6911615,2,"Oh no. Wasted a meal here during our girls trip to New Orleans. We were hoping to try some good Vietnamese food and unfortunately, didn't get that experience at CreAsian. We read the reviews but thought we'd give it a chance after trying to go to two other Vietnamese and Thai restaurants that were closed. 

The server greeted us promptly and repeatedly assured us that their food was great. He was very friendly and attentive (as we were the only ones in the restaurant during our entire meal). We started with the spring rolls, which had a nice presentation. They were fine, no complaints here and the peanut sauce was good. Next, we shared a pho broth. No good. The broth was lukewarm and the noodles were hard and stuck together. Very small portion for the price, and very minimal toppings available (mint, bean sprouts, etc.). We also ordered the combination rice plate which was just average. It was supposed to come with an egg omelette but the chef who cooks this was not available. So it came out with scrambled eggs instead.

Overall, CreAsian has a great location on Canal Street, very central. If you're looking to get a quick bite with minimal expectations, stop on in!",0
381430,1,"So yea. It's been almost a year and I'm still mad about this. Like everyone else, I paid $55 for a race that was cancelled, and that cancelation was extremely chaotic, with no announcements or clear message of what was going on. We just got to the starting line after they'd let a few waves through and were told the race was cancelled, as people kept running through. No email, no message on Twitter or Facebook except that the race had started and the first few waves had gone. There was supposed to be an after party and band playing throughout the race but none of that happened and they started just turning off the glowing stuff. I wasted money on a cab to pick up my packet, wasted money on a cab to the park, a cab home, and wasted my time on a race I was really excited about that never happened.

Even worse is how they've handled this race since then. We waited a few days for an email which promised they would reschedule soon and we could transfer our registration for free or transfer to another city. However, we would not get a new shirt or new glowsticks, and we'd have to pick up a new bib. Well we waited all fall and there was no new Philly race posted. Now it's spring and still no Philly race. I recently emailed them to see what was happening and they confirmed that there will be no Philly race this summer or probably ever. They offered me $20 to their online store. How generous. I definitely want another electric run shirt to promote their organization. I emailed again and they offered me 50% off registration for a friend. It's gonna be tough to convince a friend to travel to another city for a race I have nothing good to say about. At this point I really don't want to even do this race, let alone travel for it and waste more of my time and money. I'm going to keep emailing them to see if they can make this right and will update if they offer anything more acceptable.",0

I called and they claimed it was a no-show charge for an appointment i didn't even make. Super scammy! Wonder how much this happens and people don't even notice on their credit card statements.

5265035,2,"I will say, I think this place is really cute. It's got a very warm feel to it with oak tables and chairs. I saw the strangest array of people here from older couples to college kids to families. It's not very loud and was actually fun to sit and chat for a while. 

 First of all we ordered an appetizer and our food at the same time, and guess what, they came out at the same time. Our waiter literally sat down the app then walked back to the kitchen for the entrees. Kinda made the app pointless. 

The food itself wasn't impressive. We got the Chili Nachos, that weren't bad but weren't spectacular. Then, I ordered what they refer to as ""The Best Bacon Cheeseburger In Nashville"" - I will say this. It's the best bacon ON a cheeseburger in Nashville. The hamburger and cheese were mediocre, and the bun they were served on was so big you felt like all you were eating was bread. The fries were a tad undercooked and nothing special, but weren't bad when dipped in ranch. Also, our table didn't have salt or pepper shakers. 

I've heard you have to try their desserts, and to be honest they looked good. I just didn't have the appetite for them. I may go back to try one or to have a beer at the bar, but I won't be ordering a meal here again.",0
504741,2,"I love supporting local businesses, but every time I come here I'm disappointed. Poor quality washes every time. 

I keep a very tidy car, so after paying for the most expensive car wash option, I'm always surprised to find:
-dust on the dashboard
-tiny crumbs in the cup holders 
-random goo on the side of my car
-dust and flecks of dirt under the seats

I'm writing this review because today I specifically asked for the seats to have a good vacuum (and pointed to specific spots). When I got home, I noticed they literally only vacuumed one of the spots I pointed at. The rest of the seats don't look like they were even touched by a vacuum. So I spent an hour cleaning the seats myself. 

If I wanted to clean my car, I could pay $30 LESS and vacuum it myself at the Shell on Jackson/Magazine. Frustrating since I want to give them my business, try to explain exactly what I need, and still get poor quality service. Every time! :(

Checked in pretty late last night (2-3am), the girl at the desk was friendly enough.. Ask for my card, but no ID which I find odd coming from a background in sales/reception. 

Woke up pretty early (8am) to a notification there were 3 different charges from this hotel. That bothered me very much. So I went down to talk to a girl at the desk, (Claire, different fro girl last night in duty). She did not know why I had been charged 3 different times and it didn't even show on her side those charges were made, but it definitely showed on my side. 

After a while of trying to figure out how to refund me my money, I just told her to make it easier I would pay for everything now. After speaking with the bank, (WF) they said it would go back immediately since it was only pending. 

Now I am out of $500 because someone thought it would be fine to charge my card... 

Also when I asked to speak to a manager.. Claire kindly let me know they hardly come in on the weekends. It's not this girls fault, but it IS someone in that hotel.

The girl had a sarcastic attitude and then at one point answered a question with a sigh and said, ""I don't know"" in a rude voice. I immediately told her to transfer me to someone else. The next person wasn't much help either, she shut me down real quick & laughed when I asked what the deadline to enroll for this semester was. Do they just expect everyone to know all the steps in applying for college?! I have an idea.. Get a different job if you hate answering questions so much. I wish they had a place on their website to write reviews of their staff. 

Not to mention, it's tough when things are in other people's hands. Gotta wait for financial aid to send over my paperwork (7-10 business days), gotta keep calling because you know you won't be notified when it is received. I think the enrollment process at this college needs to be a lot more organized and needs to change. Customer service is everything, people want updates on their enrollment status & advice on what to do next. 

I'm sure it's a good school and I will still enroll DESPITE the customer service, but the process is already strenuous- hire nice and helpful staff please! I'm sure there are some there, but I haven't talked to them & people base things off first impression.

-- Restaurants inside the hotel have very good food. Good enough to give this review 2 stars instead of one.

And thus ends the positives.

Now the negatives:

-- The bed in my ""higher floor"" room was awful. It sank in and squeaked, like a bed in a bad roadside motel. I called and asked about a swap or different room, but was told neither was available. 

-- Housekeeping was a joke. I had to call them to make up my room 4 of the 6 days I was there. Also, the failed to empty the wastebaskets in my room three days in a row. And here's the best - one day they left a nice long black hair in the bathroom sink. 

-- Every employee I encountered, from the front desk to the valets to the wait staff to the bellmen all had an attitude like they could not care less if I stayed there or not. 

-- One morning I had my Do Not Disturb sign on the door, had told the front desk to hold my calls, and then, 3.5 hours after I went to sleep the phone rang. Twice. Then nothing. Just woke me up. Ten minutes later the phone rang again. And this time continued to ring until I answered it. Guess who??

The front desk. Telling me they couldn't deliver a package that had arrived for me because my DND sign was on the door. Are you freaking kidding me??? I told them I was trying to sleep and to please hold it for me. They said it would be at the concierge desk when I wanted it. 

Two hours later I went down to the concierge to get the package. The concierge said all packages were at the Fedex office on the 2nd floor. I said the front desk said it was with the concierge. He said again that all packages were at the Fedex office. I went to Fedex and the employees searched and searched but found nothing. 

I returned to my room and called the front desk, told them my tale. They said the package was... wait for it... at the concierge desk. I asked them to have it delivered to my room. They said ""We'll send it up immediately.""

45 minutes and another phone call later, they delivered the package. 

Upon checkout, I was asked how I enjoyed my stay. I said it was not good and I would not be back. The woman said ""Sorry to hear that"" then proceeded to check me out without another word. Never offered to make things right, never even asked what it was I didn't like. Just sent me on my way.

While hysterically crying  I was told it would not be able to be fixed the same day or next it was determined that I would never return to this salon. I was offered no refund or compensation.

4095745,1,"A couple months ago I went to Brinton Lake Dentists and had all of my X-rays updated. The dentist told me I had 7 cavities, all between my teeth and needed fillings. This was very surprising to me, as I take great care of my teeth and am an avid flosser. The dentist knew that my dental insurance did not cover fillings, and the office sent me a treatment plan that would have me pay $2500 for the seven fillings. 

Instead of paying for all 7 fillings, I decided to try a new dental office who accepted my insurance. Brinton Lake Dentists refused to send my X-ray records to my new dentist, even though I had repeatedly emailed and called the office asking them to. I arrived at my new dental office for an appointment to get my cavities filled... and the dentist took new X-rays. After looking at the X-rays and performing an exam, the dentist told me that I have 0 cavities. ZERO CAVITIES! After being told by Brinton Lake that I had 7. 

I am very upset with Brinton Lake Dentists, as it is obvious they wanted to take advantage of someone without dental insurance and exaggerate the need for fillings. My family members have also had negative experiences with them in the past. It is strictly business to them, they are just pumping people in and out of the office, and do not seem to care about their patients dental health and financial considerations. I am so glad that I received a second opinion so I didn't get scammed by Brinton Lake Dentists",0
1439980,2,"My initial thought was that Japonais would be a 1-star review for me, but ultimately, I decided to add an extra star because the food itself is delectable. The service, however, is another matter. 

I've been here twice, and both visits were exercises in frustration. 

Visit number 1 was fruitless - my friend and I were seated promptly, and ignored for 10 minutes  - this was mid-afternoon on a weekend, and the place was nearly empty. We left without having tasted anything more than water. 

Visit number 2 was during lunch hour on a weekday. Our party of 2 arrived early, hoping to beat the lunch rush. And, indeed we did! Only 2 other tables were seated, so we were set for a great express lunch. 

Our server took our order promptly and served us miso soup. Great start!
But then we waited. And we waited. And we waited. 

As I looked around, I saw that the neighboring table wasn't faring any better. The two ladies seated across from me were checking their watches and phones constantly, and twisting back to look at the kitchen for any signs of life. They asked to pay their bill before their food arrived - and when it did finally arrive, they scarfed down a scant few bites and dashed out of the restaurant. I felt badly for them.

Concerned, my friend asked the server how long our food would be, and she said she'd check with the back. She didn't. 

15 minutes later, and an hour since we arrived at the empty restaurant, our food finally arrived.  And yes, it was delicious. 

Unfortunately, having to get back to work, my table wolfed the contents of our boxes and walked up to the bar to pay (as we didn't want to wait a long time for the bill).

Someone who appeared to be the owner/manager of the place rang us up and asked how our lunch was. We told him the pace and service was atrocious, and he simply said, ""I'm sorry"" as he handed over the receipt. 

I'm sorry, mister owner/manager, but I won't be back to Japonais while there are equally delicious, quickly-served and economical sushi options further down Jasper Ave.",0
803486,1,"Delicious pizza, worst service I've ever had in my life. 

Ordered last week, my pizza was 40 minutes later than the delivery time they gave me. Called after 35 minutes and the lady said they were busy. No apologies made, but whatever, it happens. When we finally got it, it was cold, but we ate it any way because, well, pizza. 

Gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered again today. Placed my order at 11am, given a delivery time of noon, pizza didn't arrive until 12:45. Called at 12:40 to get an ETA and was just told ""I don't know, we're busy."" When it arrived it was cold. Won't bother ever again.

If you're so busy that you can't make delivery times, consider hiring more drivers. If you can't retain drivers I'd suggest providing a more enticing wage.

648853,1,"I had a horrible experience yesterday with the service department. Several months ago the car was in for a transmission repair wiring issue. We paid $300 to get it fixed. Now the car is having other electrical issue (well known on the internet) and I have to get it fixed. After extensive review of all the warranty documents I decided to call the 3rd party extended warranty company who told me that Dayton Andrews never even called them to see if the transmission repairs could be authorized and those items I paid $300 for would have been covered. They said often the finance section and service section don't have the same information and don't check. I also found out that what my mechanic says the new problem is, will be covered also (a very costly repair). This car was only purchased in 2012 and I don't understand why now that the sale is made, we are treated poorly with the service. I asked Mike to help me understand it and to help ensure it doesn't happen to other customers in the future. He basically told me it was my own issue and we must not have shown the paperwork (not true). He never even offered to take my information and look in to it. What a joke!

6192753,1,"The service and the food here is underwhelming. The experience started badly from the get go. The restaurant offers no paper menus because of the pandemic. Fine, I get that, they're trying to be clean. Instead they only offer a QR code to scan that goes to the online menu. Neither my girlfriend or I had a QR app on our phones, and we didn't want to be on our phones on our date. I asked for a paper menu, and the waitress snarls back that she can only bring me a paper menu if I try on my phone first and it didn't work. She left and we just sat there, because we aren't going to download an app just to eat at a restaurant. I hope CPK also considers that not everyone has or wants a smartphone. As a rule I don't use my phone during dinner. 
My recommendation to CPK here is: 1) Instead of only having a QR code to scan, also include a short link the customer can type in instead. 2) Offer a choice between the online menu or paper menu after they seat the customer. Definitely don't give attitude toward someone who prefers a traditional menu! I lie and say the QR code didn't work and she finally brings us a single paper menu. 

From here our waitress brings the food and her attitude improves to a tolerable level. My girlfriend ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it tasted okay, but not great. We both ate some of it. We've had their frozen BBQ at the grocery store, and it tasted better than the pizza at the restaurant. The restaurant pizza had very little chicken, actually less chicken than the frozen pizza. The restaurant pizza costs $18, and the frozen pizza costs $5-6. The restaurant pizza was no larger than the frozen. For over thrice the price we expected a pizza at least slightly larger than the frozen that also tasted better. I had a $22 salmon, which tasted rather plain and wasn't a lot of food. We had their butter cake dessert, which was good. 

Both of us left hungry and could have eaten more. For a restaurant at this price, we expect to leave full, be treated well, and have good food. The waitress's rude treatment to us over the menu is the part that sticks out the most and why I am leaving this restaurant 1 star.  Having a bad restaurant like this inside the Grand Sierra Resort damages the reputation of the entire resort, and the GSR should hold its restaurants to a higher standard to protect its reputation.

When I arrived I noticed immediately that the parking lot near the restaurant was full.  Once inside the bustle of the place was apparent- waitresses were everywhere and most of the booths and tables were full. This is always a good sign, right?

The prices were better than other Thai restaurants I've been to. I ordered the pad thai lunch special and the spring rolls to go. Both were 6.95.

I wish I could say I loved the food but I can't. I didn't like the thin noodles (I prefer the thicker ones) and didn't think they had much of a taste. The spring rolls, although larger than typical and cooked perfectly, were okay- but again, didn't seem to be seasoned well enough. 

Maybe it was just an off day? I want to believe this place lives up to the hype, so I'll be back if I'm in the area to give it another try in the future. For now I'm sticking with Krung Thai on Garrity.",0

This is place is a joke and I'm so glad I did not chose to live here. If I'm having this much trouble now I could only imagine how hard it would be to get anything done if I lived there.

Update: it is now 9/2 and still have not recieved my deposit back. The company sent it to an old address of mine tarnish 3 hours away and wanted me to drive there to see if it was in that mailbox. When I said no and asked for them to cut another check the replied that I would have to pay for them to stop payment on the old check.

The veggies were to large to eat with the chopsticks that it came with. We had to cut every veggie into pieces before eating them. On top of that it was severed on top of a piece of deli paper to absorb the oil still coming out of them.

6927765,2,"Woody's, once Philadelphia's premiere (and first?) gay bar, has not stood the test of time very well at all. 

This used to be our playground - growing up in Philly, it was the place to see and be seen for we gay men. Everywhere else had their niche, but paled in comparison to the almighty Woody's. Every night was a specific theme night in the main dance area - whether it was country, disco, club, latino, teeny-boppers, etc.

The ground-floor bar was renovated into a wide open space a few years ago, and certainly is nice in the summer when they can fully open their fronting glass doors/windows. The upstairs contains two dance areas, an all-out large one, and a more classy lounge-type smaller one. So far so good, I count the renovations as a great improvement. 

But Woody's quit serving their delicious food a while back after Bill Wood sold it (thankfully Bill created 'Knock', a dinner bar to serve his food). Also, Woody's more/less kicked out the cool Friday/Sunday night line dancers, which always used to draw huge crowds. And further, the dance areas now cost $10 to get into on weekends - seriously?!!

With the past decade of hordes of people moving back into the City, Woody's has become infested by amateur, new city dwelling straight couples and puking bachelorettes. Ugh - who wants to see straight couples making out in our gay bars? Not I or other gay guys! The bachelorettes would best be served moving over to the Toasted Walnut!

Car was only making that noise for 20 secs after I start the car when A/C is on and then that noise would go away. My A/C was working perfectly fine. it was just that noise. So i took my car to check at Joe's . They said $35 to check the A/C. He named almost 7 kinds of test they would do to figure out the problem so i thought it should be worth it. But guess what they figured out my whole A/C system is bad and they told me i have to repair compressor, belts, pulley and other stuffs and gave me a quote of $1020.  After i dropped my car i checked online and found out that many ppl who own a lexus car  had this problem. And the solution was just to change the old AC belt.

4930227,1,"How terrible was this place? Let me count the ways.

I should have known I was in trouble when I first came into play first came into the lobby. A woman was busily arguing with the front desk about a reservation that specifically requested she have her family next to her. The staff wasn't accommodating her. After the woman walked away I joked with the desk telling him the only way you're going to get me that mad was to lose my reservation.

Well, I get my key and all seems well. Problem is, somebody else is in my room. Oops. At the same time an irate middle aged daddy comes to the desk. Their daughter's room was also occupied. By a couple. Who were in the middle of things. Oops.

Well, we had already reached one star by that point. And the fact we had to wait another 40 minutes for a room because...oh, there were reasons involving the day shift not talking to the night shift and the cleaning crew being late. Plenty of reason for the front desk to be apologetic. They weren't though. The woman at the desk chose to be rude to my wife instead. Because that always is going to make me feel good about the place.

But at last we got to the room. And it was hot. And the air conditioner was not making it much cooler. Well, at least it had been cleaned. Nevertheess, I thought it was a good idea to revisit the front desk, because I wanted to make sure the folks had recorded tht I was now the occupent of my room. Good thing I checked -- they had the room down as uncoccupied (meaning, of course, we could have had someone trying to come in to our room!)

The rest of the stay was typical of a chain motel on the downslide -- towels not delivered timely, cleaning not actually done during our two day stay, no caffinated tea at the breakfast bar, no vent in the bathroom, meaning that the bathroom was damp, and likely frequently moldy. And the air conditioner never made the room cool.

6548485,1,"Like so many others, I live on a budget. Also, I am not in the health profession, I do not know the details of how insurance billing works - and if I wanted to know, I'd get a job doing that. I learn by asking questions. Like so many others, in the past I've been blindsided by unforeseen health costs that I couldn't afford. How do you budget for something if you don't know how much it will cost? Get quotes. So, I AM DILIGENT about asking for cost information before I see any doctor - it is necessary. Prior to making my appt. with Dr. Williams, I called and asked the staff to determine my insurance coverage. Before each of the 2 appts. that I had with Dr. Williams, I clarified what I was told about the costs. My procedure was simple, routine and therefore the estimated cost was affordable. However, they neglected to include necessary info about lab tests - as a matter of fact, the first I heard about lab tests was from Dr. Williams with his hands (and a scalpel) in my mouth... So, even after my due diligence with Dr. Williams' office staff, I got walloped with an expensive lab bill that I was not prepared to pay. Here's the kicker: when I called to ask about the charges and the difference of the original quote, the staff was immediately defensive, with an attitude that it was my mistake, that it was out of their hands, that they were not responsible and ultimately, that I was SOL, they were done with me and therefore, it was for me to deal with - too bad, so sad. They did not take any responsibility for their nondisclosure - they were very disrespectful and dismissed my concerns as an insignificant bother - for them, in that moment, i was not a patient, just some lady with some blahblahblah that should just go away. I believe that ""healthcare"" isn't JUST the procedures performed but includes the ""CARE"" you give to patients from beginning to end. Dr. Williams' may be a good surgeon but I wouldn't know.

Disappointed due to the fact that the menu was very ho hum, not creative and the cooking of my dish was very poorly executed, I must say the other diners did enjoy their meal but, I may be a bit more critical. Given the up and the downside, the downside rules and I would not dine at this restaurant again.",0

4942403,1,"Sadly, Very disappointed.   We often go to the Pi in the loop and it is great and well managed. This one not so much.  Greeter was sub par.  Restaurant not busy and many open tables.  We asked for an open high top table near the bar and there were several open.  Greeter looks confused and has to ask a manager.  Manager apparently says fine and we are seated.  We then order pizza and beers.  Pizza is supposed to have sausage and doesn't.  We tell server and she comes back and says the chief said it is ""difficult to put the sausage on 1/2 a pizza"".  I don't really understand what that even means.  Pi Management: When a customer tells a server the order is wrong there are really only three correct responses. 1. Bring the customer the correct order, or in my case some sausage.  2. Comp something.  3. Check in with customer to see if everything was made okay.  What you basically did is imply I was wrong or or stated that it is too hard to make a pizza with sausage.",0

We were both surprised by the polish and atmosphere inside; much more than the diner feel we were both expecting.  The waitstaff was also very friendly and kept our glasses full throughout, while electo-tunes gave a mild club feel.  A promising start!

However, the food was a bit lack-luster given the pricing, which is where my rating stems from .  I guess it's the Center City premium.  The Turkey Club wasn't assembled with much more than toasted Wonder bread and lunch meat, and my Mexican chopped salad, while very tasty, felt a bit on the small side for $10+.

The only reason I might come back would be to try out the fun looking swinging chairs that accompany some of the second floor tables, but otherwise I was underwhelmed.",0

They said they didn't give out the code because it ""interfered with business."" Really? This is 2014 and I'm pretty sure most businesses can do business while still offering a guest WiFi channel.

But beware when paying with coupon certificate and look carefully items that were charged on your receipt! I bought a $15 certificate for $30 worth of spending from DoubleTakeDeals. I thought it was a great deal. I ordered Item # 40 gyro platter and # 41 beef for a price $8.90 each. But on the receipt, I was charged for $12.90. I asked the waitress why the price was differrent. The waitress replied that the lunch price was not applicable for this certificate. I did not know that the items I ordered were lunch menu, neither the coupon did not state any restrictions. Not only that the waitress tried to persuade me to take out a drink because my total bill was $29.30, less than $30.00 worth. A drink cost me $2.50. A new  total price recipt summed up to $35 after tax. I waited for my drink which never came. The service is poor.  The waitress I had was forgetful and ignorant. She forgot that I ordered spaghetti for my son. By the time I almost finished my meal, the spaghetti just came. It was steamy hot that I had to keep stirring it up in air to cool it down for awhile. Then my son dropped his fork on the floor. She promised she will bring a new fork but never did. She tried to fool me with my coupon price and pretended being apologetic. Initially she subtracted $15 off from total price because she thought I did not know what my coupon worth for.  Then I told her that she should subtract $30 off.  By the time I exited our from this restaurant, I looked at my watch that I stayed almost 2 hrs in this restaurant. Half of the time just to spend for revising the receipts. My husband recommended me that next time we should buy Gyro at Tucson Mall food Court. The taste and quantity are much better, and the service is fast.",0

I said forget it and drove to my usual wash, 5 min away btw. Out the door, $10.99 with a coupon. I shouldn't have to pay close to $30 for a ""good"" wash and clean for the inside. 

I highly recommend The Classic Car Spa on Grant and Tucson.

We asked if they would be refreshing everything soon, and they promised they would. During our time at Minerva, they refreshed maybe two of the 8 items. So we didn't get to sample much. Everything I did try was overly spicy, that you couldn't even taste the flavors. The man running the cash registered was pretty rude too. He asked if I enjoyed the buffet and I told him I was let down with the lack of refreshing the bare buffet, and he told me well you should of come earlier. Oh well!

I was feeling a little hungry and thought I'd stop at Walgreens for a quick snack. While standing on the isle trying to choose a snack, a Walgreens worker walked passed me, she gave me a very mean look, so I smiled and said, ""hi, how are you tonight "" she very roughly said ""hi"". So, I choose my snack, it was beef jerky on sale for 1.99. Got to the register and no one was there. So, I walked towards the isles and saw the same worker that seemed angry earlier. I asked ""excuse me, mam, are you working at the register?"" She said ""yes"" , I told her I was ready to check out. She walked to the register, I honestly felt the hatred towards me radiating from her. I've never met this lady in my life before this. I don't know what I could have done. She rang me up , I noticed after I already gave her my 5 dollar bill, she rang me up for too much, the total was 2.90, I asked her why it rang up so high. She asked do I have a rewards card. Well, yes I do. At that point, I'm done with her bad attitude. I'm just ready to leave. I'm like, please just give me my 5 back, I don't want the beef jerky, she refused to just hand me my money back, she made me stand there while she did a refund. The guard walked up and told me to calm down. I was calm. I really feel I was being harassed by this lady. After asking for my 5 back, she handed me 4 ones and a handful of change, anyone could tell she was doing that just to spite me not getting my 5 back. I was harassed. There was zero customer service here. I am the type of person that's always happy and cheery. I don't understand why I was treated this way.",0

Next strike was the actual food. I ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo. I am visiting New Orleans so I had good hopes for the outcome. Well..... The flavor was lacking. The temperature was room temperature. I had to walk to the server to seek out condiments. Normally when I go to restaurants, the server comes and checks on the guests to ensure that the service is going well. This place did not! The shrimp was not completely peeled so I was chewing on shells part of the time. Tragic.....

I got the burger. I ordered it med-rare, it came out extra-well. This is one of my biggest pet peeves. Don't ask me how I want my burger cooked, if you can't get anywhere near what I ask for. The other elements of the burger had good flavor, but they were drowned out by the char burned taste of the meat. The ""pomme frites"" that come with the burger are not what you expect when you see pomme frites. They were almost like steak fries, and well under cooked. The potato was hard, and not crispy at all. It's not difficult to do burger and fries.

I waited off to the side for them to prepare the sandwich so not to hold up the line and as the worker brought out my sandwich and dropped the bag on the ground and napkins and condiments and the wrapped sandwich hit the ground. I saw in my rear view mirror. She picked it and bright it to the car anyway! And told me it had not fallen on the ground. As if I was blind. I asked for the manager who stated she would not refund me for the sandwich but would remake it. I explained I didn't trust their food handling practices and simply wanted a refund for the sandwich and she refused. I don't think she was a manger because earlier in the interaction she was confused about what dip comes with pretzels and a manager would know that.,0

I ordered the Earl Grey milk tea. I was disappointed with this. The bubbles were normal but had no sweetness or flavor. The milk tea itself tasted like milk with a hint of tea flavor.  I understand the whole ""natural ingredients"" aspect, but they need to focus on the flavor of it also. The tea either needs a more concentrated flavor or they need higher quality tea.

I just know that I have to be more self-sufficient and take more time to find what I'm looking for since someone who works there is not going to help me. Personal conversations between employees in the aisles are commonplace as customers pass by without anyone asking if they need assistance. I live alone and work long hours so I don't do a lot of cooking. I often visit the prepared food and salad bars to grab lunch or dinner. It is definitely pricey but the alternative is buying a bunch of food that ends up in the trash so it is worth it to me.  The quality varies depending on the time of day but I can usually find items that are good and fresh.  I stopped by this evening and the condition of the hot food was atrocious. All of the dishes were dried out, crusty, and had obviously not been attended to for some time.  That they were expecting people to pay for what was on there is hard to believe.

Room was fine until the room wouldn't stay cool...in fact the temperature would constantly go above the temperature set point. Really?!? In a hot and humid city that's the last thing I wanted. Well should have been happy with that. Day 2: after sightseeing in the heat and humidity went back up to room at around 5 and housekeeping hadn't cleaned room. Then the heater automatically turns on. Called front desk and told they're still cleaning rooms. Umm, nope, no one in sight! Asked for fresh towels. Also told I must be setting thermostat wrong. Wtf?!? I'm a grown woman who can handle a thermostat. Decided to freshen up before meeting friend for dinner and wait for it..door opens not once but three times!! Thank goodness I had deadbolt on. Kept yelling ""there's someone in here""! Guess the man at the door was determined to get in! Front desk calls me and wants to know who I am and why I'm in the room! SERIOUSLY?!? I'm not only shaking but f*cking pissed at this point. I explain I had checked in the day before. After a few minutes they said ""oh it must be a computer glitch"". Ok so I get a ready and there's a knock in the door...Security came up to investigate. I explain what happened and fortunately he believed my story. So I'm thinking this is how Hyatt treats their female single business travelers! Next, my room key has been deactivated! PERFECT! I go to the bar to calm my nerves and the bar tender was extremely nice and comped me a glass of wine. 

Day 3: leave for evening and left front light on. Return from dinner and it's off. Here's a suggestion: if a guest leaves a light on DON'T turn it off. Turns out housekeeping came in with turn down service, mints on pillow, bucket of ice, large bottle of water, and music on. Excellent, but be mindful of what just happened the day before...still jittery in room. 

Day 4: returned after last night out and had turn down service the same as the night before. 

Great touch during last two nights! Conference area was good and conference food fair. All in all because my experience early on was so bad and the guest service was appalling that lowered the rating.

Chicken and Rice Soup was Bland and void of any taste.

Pig Intestines in a Garlic Sauce - Very good, authentic, great taste

Seafood Delight was a failure. Portion ridiculously small, had absolutely no taste, bland and the seafood was rubbery due to over cooking. 

Sweet and Sour Shrimp another failure. Again, no taste, Again grossly over cooked.

2 of the 3 entrees were just lousy and both were half left. The server just didnt have a clue. 

I encouraged someone to order another entree, people were hungry. They decided to play it safe and ordered the General Tso Chicken. FAILURE for the same reasons as before.  WHERE IS THE SEASONINGS, the HEAT??? It was terrible.

The service was not attentive, the service was just going through the motions.

I'm writing this review from memory of having tried their dishes out 2 or 3 times over the course of 2015-2016, so please let me know if there was a chef change / major menu overhaul since then, as I have not been back to try their food in recent months.

The decor and service was fine, nothing memorable in a positive or negative way. Every time I've gone was with my parents, and they agreed that it was pretty subpar food taste-wise. We ordered things from the Fuqi Feipian (cold starter dish), the spicy water-boiled fish fillet, spicy potato with jalapenos, etc. Honestly the flavors were just not very good, and authenticity aside, it just wasn't TASTY, which I care more about in this day-in-age than whether something tastes 1000% ""authentic.""

There was no side of fruit or hashbrowns to create a more filling meal, just stale white bread toast.

3452509,2,"For the positives, server Juan was good, and the place was clean . it was so good to see the place on a wait list!! However, fish (fish And chips) was over cooked and no tartar sauce, even after we asked. Chopped salad with a crab cake...good, although the crab cake was filled with bits of shell, very disappointing. Calamari was very tender, but the batter was soggy and mushy. We should have went somewhere else.",0
1592655,1,"This restaurant was recommended by a local so my husband, daughter, and I were expecting something great. It was barely edible at best. The crawfish and corn bisque was the best thing we ate at this establishment and that's not saying much. We also had the seafood combo which included crawfish étouffée, jambalaya, and shrimp creole which was not good at all. My husband ordered the seafood gumbo, took one bite and one was enough to know it was beyond disgusting. The waiter never asked why most of our food was uneaten or if it was good. I'm afraid he already knew the answer to the question. The bread was excellent but not worth the $105 we spent on this meal. We happened to walk into another shop a few minutes later in the area who also recommended this place and I realized that locals send what they assume to be tourists to this place because they figure tourists won't know any better. Well, guess what, we aren't tourists. I was born and raised an hour from New Orleans and I know what good food is; this isn't it. Keep on looking if you want a true taste of what this area can offer. I am here visiting family from CA and this is my most regrettable $100 spent so far on this trip.",0

A bunch of young kids that refuse to help and the manager is worthless. Not sure how she has her job, she is unprofessional and lazy. I was there an hour before closing the manager gets on the loud speaker announcing the store will be closing. Seriously an hour before closing then she proceeds to announce every 5 minutes that the store will be closing. Who does that, I get everyone wants to go home on time but every 5 mins announcing the store will be closing for a full hour. So I rush to the register thinking maybe I looked at the closing time wrong or their hours change. Nope she was just trying to chase ppl out the store. I asked the cashier to call the manager to look 3 bar stools I was purchasing because they had stains or crack and I wanted a discount. She comes to the register the cashier tells her the situation and she punched something in the register and walks away. No eye contact with me nor did she say a word to me. Even the poor cashier was like I think she gave you 10% off. So i said I don't want them unless she gives me a better deal. The cashier tells the manager what I said in the little mic they all carry, her response was tell her to leave it. Seriously so unprofessional to her customers and employees. I end up taking the bar stools because I really like them and I can probably fix them up. So upon checking out the cashier needed an override and calls the manager back to the register. Here comes the manager dragging her feet and acting like the cashier was bugging her. Here I am trying to carry all 3 bar stools to my car. As i walk out the door the manager and another employee is joking about how strong I am to carry all 3 bar stools instead of trying to assist me. You best believe this is the last time I will ever shop here.",0
3631381,2,"Ooof.  Came in this past Friday at about 5:45 to get dinner before a show at Bridgestone.  There was only one other table plus a few folks at the bar, so we assumed getting dinner in a timely fashion wouldn't be an issue.  When the server was taking our order, he mentioned that they had a new menu.  My friend ordered a steak salad and I ordered a burger.  About 10-15 minutes later, her salad came out, and the server asked us if we had ordered anything else.  Ummm, MY food?  He got flustered, made another comment about the new menu, and said he would go find out.  For the next 20 minutes, he walked in and out of the kitchen, but didn't come over to update me on the status of my food.  I had to get up and go ask him, and he said it would be another few minutes.  He babbled about the stupid new menu again and said it wasn't sent through to the kitchen.  Great whatever.  Please get me my food.  The burger finally came out, about 25 minutes after my friend's salad.  When the check came, another mention of the new menu.  The burger was delicious, which is the only reason they're getting 2 stars.  I worked in the service industry for a very long time.  I understand that mistakes happen.  But COMMUNICATE with the hangry customer who is watching their friend eat.  The fact that he didn't come back over to update me was infuriating.  You can lie to me, blame it on the kitchen, I don't care, I'm not going to go in there to check.  Acknowledge the issue instead of ignoring it.  If there was a new menu, maybe being proactive about making sure that orders are transmitting properly to the kitchen would go a long way, especially when the restaurant is approximately 4% full.  No sort of money was taken off our bill, nor were we offered any kind of compensation.  The staff needs to get their act together.",0

They had my van for one week and didn't do anything with it, after 10 days they asked my permission to start breaking the engine down because all the codes came up interior engine damage. I authorize them to do this and after 18 days the service manager called me and said I need a new engine. They said the oil had a little sludge in it and so it has very little compression and it's a maintenance issue because of that. All they did was check the oil in 18 days they didn't give a crap about me losing business and I asked for an explanation from the manager and the service guy and they didn't have answers for me why nothing was done.

Truly the best tacos in Boise that we'd found (had tried multiple taco trucks), and the lady who was often working was super nice. Sometimes the food is a little inconsistent (dry limes, they forget to put onions on the plate, etc.), but no deal-breakers. But for the past few months every time we go, if there are spanish-speaking people who get there AFTER we've ordered, they ALWAYS get served first. Tonight we stood outside in the freezing cold for almost half an hour after ordering, while about half a dozen spanish-speaking patrons walked right up and were handed food quickly after ordering. I guess El Chavo only cares about business from latinos? My husband happens to be Mexican, I guess they just couldn't tell. Maybe he should have ordered in Spanish? Anyway, we're over it.

The sausage parmigiana sandwich was tasteless.  The sausage was plain, the sauce had zero flavor and there was nothing special about the cheese.  I will say however the bread was good.

Not the best part.  To use the bathroom you must walk through the kitchen.  Yup, right past the prep table to the bathroom you go. In my years of restaurant management I have never seen this before and never will.

Now, I've eaten at Arby's hundreds of times, all around the country. I know what a regular roast beef should look like. These two - had about 20% - 1/5th - the normal, expected amount of roast beef on them. I guess they're running low on everything - frying oil, curly fries, pies, and roast beef.

The chicken was almost like jerky. Dry and hard. I feel like it was partially cooked already, left out and then cooked again. There is no way that the cook, saw this chicken and was proud of what he/she served, no way.

While discussing the tasteless chicken, the waitress noticed that my daughter stopped eating her steak tacos and asked her if it was alright. My daughter ate a big bite of gristle and bailed on the meal. We explained to the waitress and she said she'd bring it to her manager. Typically if a customer had a complaint about a meal you'd have a visit from the manager to try to make it right or offer another option. But sometimes it just gets comp'd and you move on.

979069,2,"Well after wanting to try this place for awhile I was really hoping to like/love this place. Unfortunately I neither liked nor loved anything about this place.

The hostess was nice and greeted us quickly and was looking for a table, even thou it was 5:30pm and the place was less than half full. I offered we would sit in the bar at a booth if that made it easier for her. She agreed and seated us.

My boyfriend and I are average size, I'm on the shorter side but trying to squeeze in the booth was challenging. Once in the table came up to my neck. Not a comfortable seating arrangement to eat comfort food!

The server arrived and took our drink orders. Drinks were served promptly and I did like the glassware and decor. We order the Crab cakes for a appetizer.

Crab cakes arrived and for 12.95 the size was unimpressive. Two half dollars sized extra crispy on one side (if I cooked them I would say burnt). I fished out many pieces of shells and chucked it up to that's what you get for eating crab cakes. Not impressed

My boyfriend odered the catfish poboy with okra. I decided on the special top sirloin with the sweet potato casserole and mac and cheese. The server told my boyfriend it's the best poboy and you would think your in New Orleans. I asked about the mac and cheese and she stated it was better than her grandmas.

Also, i must say we never got any complimentary corn bread or knew about it till leaving.

The food arrived and this is where truly I'm shocked. The catfish was straight out of a box as well as the okra ( if guessing coming from GFS located behind the restaurant). My sweet potato casserole was most likely yams from a can mashed with a sprinkle of brown sugar. The mac and cheese was boiled macaroni with shredded chesse then heated. I will say my steak was cooked perfectly and tasted decent.

After eating we had empty drink glasses never asked to be refilled even though the manager passed by our table several times. The server was the bartender and was busy but the manager who was dressed inappropriate could have asked us if we needed refills.

By this time I just wanted the check. After 57.00 plus tip I can honestly say we will never be back. We paid for tasteless, greasy, and food that could have gotten at a local gas station.

As someone who works in this industry I can be forgiving of many things but the 4 dishes we had were all pretty disgusting. After suffering through the first course we hoped that our second course would be better. This was definitely the worse fois gras preparation I have ever had!! The second course was so bad we asked for the check and went somewhere else for dinner. Service was also disappointing and the manager did not seem to mind our experience at all stating that ""most people like the food."" I would never dream of saying this to a dissatisfied customer and I would also never charge people for food they clearly did not eat or enjoy. This restaurant should reevaluate their menu and management. This was by far one of the most awful dining experiences I have ever encountered! Don't waste your time or money coming here!!!",0

6174963,2,"We ordered take out for 6:30 pm. Arrived at the restaurant for the 6:30 time and after a 10 minute drive home discovered all of the food was cold. Two of the three dishes were seafood with rice, similar to paella and one was pan fried fish.   Very disappointing, considering you have to schedule a pick up time and it was very expensive. $165 for three entrees, one appetizer and one ceviche.  The food was Ok. I personally liked the ceviche best, but with taxes and tip, I wouldn't do it again. Not worth it in my opinion. The prices listed on the online menu are not consistent with prices for take out.  Take out entrees are each $5 more and apps prices are higher as well.
Finally, I ordered online and requested no cilantro.  Cilantro was sprinkled on just about every item.
If you want to eat here, don't order take out!!!!!",0
3779500,2,"The last 30 minutes before this store closes is a madhouse, especially on a Saturday! Employees main focus reorganizing clothes whilst having one person at the register. The result? An extremely long line of tired, irritable patrons wondering why there are not more employees behind the cash registers to expedite their checkout process instead of , ""folding clothes and doing nothing."" Quite a nightmare.

Last night, When a frustrated (and impatient) woman asked to speak to the manager to see if there was any way she could possibly help speed up the checkout process, I was astonished when the young woman's response was, ""I'm the manager but I was not trained at the cash register. I cannot ring people up, I don't know how."" No apologies. Nothing. She simply walked away.

Whether or not the manager was telling the truth is neither here nor there; I can understand why the manager said that- Priorities- you need to get your employees out at a decent hour and want a clean store without having it take forever... but she could have been nicer or said something perhaps a bit differently.

5637311,1,"Disappointed. The restaurant was very busy. We waited for 45 minutes. Our server, Adrian, was very attentive. After waiting longer than usual, our meals arrived and my herb crusted salmon looked burnt. It also tasted strange. (Sidenote: we come here every other week and I order the exact same thing every time.) I wasn't pleased, and when the server noticed how it looked, he was also surprised, and took it back to get it remade. He said the head chef said there were too many herbs on it. I waited for another 25 minutes, while my husband ate his meal, and then it arrived plated to go as I requested. I took a bite, and it was gross...totally different taste AND get this...it was like warm (at best). How is that possible when I waited over 25 mins for a re-make and you couldn't even make sure my food was warm. Smh! Adrian got the salmon removed. But guess what I'm still hungry. And I missed a whole lunch date with my husband. I then called the manager over to see if something changed. His response was ""herbs change with the season"" as if I'm not aware of herbs. And no he did not ask if he could get me anything else. I'm so annoyed. So I wasted over 2 hours to leave and still be hungry. I'm giving 1 Star because our server was stellar and it wasn't his fault that the restaurant has failed under pressure.",0

Our coffee and waters were brought fast but that is where the service started to decline. We placed our orders for a double French toast and the two egg special after browsing the menu and reading the Yelp reviews of the French toast. By this time I was almost finished with my cup of coffee but the waitress did nothing. While waiting on our food we both finished our cups of coffee and were about halfway finished with out waters when our food was delivered. Again the waitress did nothing about refilling the glasses. We asked for refills after having to flag down the only waitress for the entire restaurant and we again kept waiting and waiting. By the time we finished our food we still did not have a refill and decided to just grab our check. Once again we had to flag down the waitress because she never once asked how the food tasted, if everything turned out like ordered or brought us the refills we asked for. As for the food it was a typical small diner food with the French toast being rather underwhelming after the previous Yelp reviews of it being amazing.

6251638,1,"Yep! horrible, horrible, horrible. Brought my cat in because it had been in a fight. I would also give this place absolutely zero stars. 
Recounting just how horrible it is will only force me to relive it. But here are the highlights:
Was advised on the phone that I should bring the cat in because it may be in shock. Later I find out that this person is a receptionist.--most places you are talking to a technician.
Did not examine the cat in front of me. I have no idea what they did! I've known my cat for 13 years--never had it taken away to be seen. I may not be a vet, but I know that cat better than these strangers. You think you might want the owner around to answer questions--ask questions??
Was given a $500 estimate for xrays, bloodwork. Had to talk them out several line items. They brought me another estimate later. Again, had to talk them out of several very expensive line items.Mostly I just negotiated prices with them, while they held my cat in a secret back room.
Wait was over 4 hours to have this work done. They told me it would take 1/2 to do the blood work. Two hours later, I was still being ignored. It was 1/2 wait between when they told me he could go home and when they actually brought him to me. Then another 1/2 hour wait to get the antibiotics. All they did to this cat was draw blood. This place is not bustling with activity.
I dealt with at least four different people over the course of this ordeal. Only the doctor seem to convincingly know what was happening, and even then, I had to remind her of what I was really there for. 
In the end, I had really brought the cat in because I was concerned about something I saw in his mouth in addition to his fight wounds. By the time I left, the concern in his mouth was gone. (I now believe he had a collection of fur stuck in his bottom teeth that was wet and matted and looked to me like dead skin--very weird) When I tried to ask someone about it, they acted like I was crazy and had no idea what I was talking about. 
Bad communicators, no real concern for the animal, totally ripping people off. I should never had taken him in, and they should have known this upon seeing me! I was their fool.",0

I asked the hostess and she said the manager told them not to see anyone. There were many empty tables. Reason, the kitchen was backed up. Once seated we waited another 15 minutes before our order was taken. Music was LOUD! I told the waitress to bring our meal at the same time however she bought my husband and my daughters meal and not mine. My family was finished eating when my meal came. I spoke with the manager she took my meal off the bill after I strongly complained. Also never did I get a dessert that I paid for.

282254,1,"I'm upset at myself for not having checked Yelp before ordering from this company (especially the filtered reviews) as other Yelp reviewers have had the same issues with customer service being non-responsive after reporting an issue. Poor quality control on the cookies that I received and poor customer service dealing with issues. 

I don't like writing bad reviews and have only written one other 1-star review before in the 8 years I've been on Yelp so I waited two weeks before writing this review while waiting for a response from the owner (still no reply) as I had requested a partial refund since I had no choice but to use some cookies. Also, prior to my email, the owner was prompt at responding to two emails regarding questions. 

I really liked this concept and was excited about giving out customized fortune cookies for my daughter's birthday party.

I ordered 50 Traditional Vanilla Fortune Cookie. I needed 38 minimum as party favors for all the students in my daughter's class (the rest were going to be for staff and teachers) but only 31 were good enough to hand out as party favors. Many cookies looked like someone made them in a rush or as if a child or an amateur practicing to fold the cookies made them. They looked nothing like the beautiful cookies on the website. 

The company was nice enough to give 15 extra cookies but it didn't matter since 31 fortune cookies had problems such as being: 
= Poorly or unevenly folded  
= Black specks (in two bags)
= Disfigured
= Strange colors on cookie (a big green and white spot and a dark brown cookie)
= Crushed or cracked (lots of crumbs in the ""good"" sealed cookie bags)
= Plastic bag melted into cookie (this was only one of the cookie that was actually made well but because the bag was melted into the cookie, I couldn't use it)

I didn't have enough ""good"" cookies for all the kids, teachers and staff so I just didn't give anything to staff and teachers and gave the remaining kids some of the poorly made cookies. The rest I was too embarrassed to give out and would have readily sent them back had I received a response.  

I took pictures of all the problem cookies right after I opened the box because I really was so disappointed in the quality control and emailed the pictures to the owner. Again, no response. This company does not have a customer satisfaction guarantee. 

I will try to end on a positive note. I broke open 3 cookies to try them since I was concerned that if the quality was poor, the cookies may not be okay but they actually tasted good. Too bad...such a cool concept.",0

5095803,1,"I had family in town so we went to PY Steakhouse so we could enjoy and upscale, celebratory meal together. The steaks were good but we ordered polenta with truffle butter and it came in a bowl with half an inch of butter on top which made it basically inedible. I asked the server if it was normally this greasy. She said, ""Yep that's how the chef serves it,"" and then walks away. Because it wasn't cheap and we were trying not to ruin our family evening together, my uncle ate it and we moved on. Then, my cousin found a small hair in her food but, again, we decided not to make a big deal out of it. Accidents happen so we decided to mention it. The last straw happened  ar the end of dinner. My uncle was trying to find his wallet and reached down onto the seat and in the crevice sticking out was a fake fingernail that fell off someone's hand. The waitress was walking up and I was like, ""uhhhh, there is a fingernail in this seat."" She was just like oh my God that's so gross and then she turned around to walk away. I had to stop her and ask her to take it off the table. no can you please take it off our table. She refused to touch it so WE had to wrap it in a napkin to give to her. She took the napkin and left the bill. At thus point we finally asked for the manager. We explained the entire situation and voiced our frustrations. She ended up comping the polenta but in response to the nail situation she said they clean the chairs all the time so she didn't know how it could have happened and it's ""too bad that it happened to you"" and then wished us a good night. So, to recap, the staff obviously has poor hospitality training, the food is hit or miss (good steaks, greasy polenta), and the level of food handling and sanitation is very low.

They post a sign on their front door that MASKS ARE REQUIRED but NO ONE enforces it so you have a mall full of people not wearing them during a pandemic.  When you call the mall office, they say they are required in the common areas but their security will not enforce it.  So why even post a sign?  As for the stores, it is up to each individual store to make up their guidelines so most do not require anything. So again, why even post a sign if your stores are not even required and you are too lazy to enforce in common areas.

5105192,1,"This has to be one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. I am by far a picky customer. We sat down only to be waited on by a less than experienced waitress. She took our order. After 20 minutes the order of two simple bib and blu salads come out wrong. We simply asked for blue cheese dressing on the side. They came with ranch on the salads. We sent them back which we never like to do. They come back out after another 20 minutes. To say they were small was an understatement. They literally had 4 shrimp on them and two leaves of bib lettuce. These are $15 salads.

Again not a picky diner but this place is a joke. 

I wondered why there was only 4 customers when we walked in... now we know why.

1717103,2,"Lately there seem to be only two types of reviews that I write. Either extremely bad service/food reviews, or the ""oh my god that was amazing I can now die a happy man"" type of review. Unfortunately this will be the former. 

I stopped here with my daughter (9) after we did some shopping in the area stores on a Sunday. Time was about 4:30.  The restaurant was not busy, only about 25% full at the most. 

Walked in and no one was in line waiting to be seated. Had to wait about 30 seconds for the hostess to finish her conversation with the other teenage hostesses before she turned around to ask how many. Said ""two,"" and then she said ""let me see if the table is clean."" Eh, wha? The place was 25% full. So we watch her walk (slowly) down the row of booths, where there are three or four that are empty but not cleaned yet. Hostess goes all the way down to the end, then comes back towards the middle, stops, looks at a table, grabs a spray bottle and towel that were sitting there, sprays the table and wipes it down as well as the seats. 

Again, folks, the place was 25% full. This whole scene takes 3 minutes. 

It was like I was in bizarro world. For one thing, there were tons of other tables available, in all sections. For another, if the hostess is responsible for wiping down tables, and the place is 25% full, then there should never be three or four booth that are dirty.  

She walks back and asks ""how many again?"" 

Ok, so we finally get seated, get a waitress a few minutes later. We're ready to order, put the whole order in. Midget gets the pretzel bites ($4.99), I get the short rib and cheese covered shoestring fries. Appetizers take a very long time to arrive for a place that was quiet -- about 10 minutes. 

And when I grab a fry, it is a) soggy and b) not even lukewarm. If a place isn't busy, those fries should be fresh. I worked in enough restaurant kitchens in my day to notice when someone is serving me fries that have been sitting in the basket above the fryer for 10 minutes. At McDonalds, I can deal with it. For $12, however, Im not. 

So I send the fries back -- first time in a decade I have ever sent anything back to the kitchen. A few minutes later, my fries return. And when I say RETURN -- I mean that literally. Because they simply nuked my previous ones in the microwave, put them in a new bowl, and threw some new cheese/short rib on top. I know they nuked it because I immediately dug down for a fry in the middle and it was as cold as before. 

But by now my daughter is starving for the fries, they do look good. So we dive in. Sandwiches come a few minutes later, with a ""can I get anything for you?"" request. Sure, I say, a couple of drink refills please. 

5 minutes

10 minutes

15 minutes go by, no refill. Waitress doesn't even stop by to check up and she is nowhere in sight. Finally she comes by at the end of the meal, we've both finished. No refills in sight.

3266419,1,"The place looked deserted, so a friend and I decided to pop in before a preseason Ram's game. Our reasoning being that since it was so dead and we had an hour till the start of the game that we wouldn't have to wait long for our lunch. We didn't want to miss the kickoff!
My friend and I were seated and waited close to 15 minutes before a reluctant waitress stumbled towards us. Since we had been staring at the menu for 15 minutes we knew what we wanted to order food wise. We told the waitress that we wanted to place our food order but the waitress refused to take our food order, she would only take our drink order and would come back for the food order....another 10 minutes pass by the time she comes back with our drinks and takes our food order.  We do not see our waitress again for another 30 minutes and that is only because she had to deliver our food. 

About the food. 
I ordered a Blue Cheese & Bacon Burger w/ fries and my friend ordered the Cowboy burger with fries. 
I ordered my burger medium and it came out a hard char well done. The burger itself was dry and had no flavor or seasoning to it. It was so dry that I had to go up to the bar to ask for some steak sauce and a beer to choke down this dry nasty burger. Let it be known that I never put steak sauce on anything except for fries from time to time.  

Definitely will be avoiding any Joey B's restaurants in the future.. oh and they made me miss kickoff!!!",0

The history - After the first day with my car on site, they stated they could not get my car started.  I had to drive to the shop to show the auto mechanics how to jump start my car.  One would think that a repair shop could remedy this issue on their own.

After several apologies, I then agreed to give them another day with a verbal guarantee they would be completed at 9:30AM,  When I arrived at 5PM later that second day, the tires were still not installed.  When I asked why they did not call, I was informed ""that phones work both ways!!!""  Lastly, when I asked for my keys so I could take the car somewhere else they could not produce my keys.  They were in the managers pocket who was off running an errand and this forced me to wait around for him to return.  To me this is unacceptable my car key should never have left their premises!

We had the carpets professionally cleaned before moving out but they said it ""smelled funny"" so they did it again and charged us (no doubt keeping a kick back). They also told us the walls would not have to be repainted if there was no damage. There wasn't any damage, we didn't hang a single thing but they repainted the whole house anyway and charged us. They also put every single tenant and every single co-signers name on the security deposit check which makes it impossible to cash. We have spent 7 months now trying to get our deposit back which will be only a fraction of what we paid despite keeping the house in perfect shape.

5319594,2,"I like this place, but recommend getting everything BUT the BBQ. 

I visited yesterday. Second day with clients in town and I thought this cool little spot would be a great place to show off some STL cue. Plus... all my favs for guests are all closed on Monday (Sydney Street, Niche, Terrene). I've been here a few times before and like it's quaint atmosphere. 

They were out of everything liquid. My first two beer orders and my guests first wine order were not available. The waitress claimed that they get their liquor order on Tuesdays... which is fine, but I was amazed that they run out of so many things on a weekly basis. By the way, they were out of Diet Coke too. 

Frustrated, I just asked the waitress to bring out one of the draft beers that they did have. At this point I didn't care which. She brought out a vanilla porter. Yum. It was awesome. I'm glad I had her pick because I wouldn't have selected this and it was so good. My guests landed on a Pinot from Aquainas. It was ok... but they seemed pleased. 

We started with the smoked wings, and smothered fries. Both were on special. I really like these wings. They're some of my favorites in town. They come out charred black with dipping sauce. They're meaty, smokey, and good. The fries are smothered in a white velveetaish sauce and bacon bits. We were starving after a long day of work and both hit the spot. 

Service here sucked, actually. Don't get me wrong, our waitress wasn't screwing around, she simply was too busy. And due to her speeding around, she was super rushed at the table. We had trouble flagging her down to order dinner, and to request items like straws and extra napkins. I didn't really get it. There were two servers... but she had 8 or 9 tables while the other guy had one. Oh well... I hope this is an anomaly as I've experienced much better service here previously. 

For dinner we ordered the Big Jimmy's sampler. It consists of ribs, chicken, pulled pork, and brisket. It was just average. I know better than to order BBQ late at night. It's always dry and looses that juicy, fall off the bone quality. Again, my guests were fine with it, but I couldn't help but think that I could make better cue at home. Again, as I said before, I'll be back because I like this place, but next time I'll steer away from the smoked meat entrees. 

We loaded up with a bunch of sides. We tried the Mac & Cheese, green bean casserole, creamed corn, mashed potatoes, and the chili sampler. If you like butter and gooey cheese, you'll like this place. The mac & cheese, and creamed corn are so loaded with them that they start to harden after a few minutes. The sides were good. I liked the beans and duck chili (one of the 4 chili samplers) best. 

My guest lefts super pleased... which was my goal by going here. I left hoping my next time back will be better.",0
1616205,2,"We came to this location because the original location was closed due to a flood of some sort. I'm going to start with the good - the fried chicken was amazing. Super crunchy and juicy. The Mac and cheese comes green peas that we're so yummy! 

Now for the bad - We waited about 45 min to get seated. Service was SO awful. Our waitress took our order abt 20 min after we were seated. Our food was brought out before our drinks and utensils. She forget to bring our extra sides. We waited abt 20-30 min for the tab. Finally we just decided to add everything up and leave the money o the table. At this point the waitress decided to give us the check. The food was really delicious but because the service was so horrendous I wouldn't recommend this location.",0

5114664,1,"How a restaurant at a nice resort gets away with such terrible service and food is beyond me.

I'm a guest at the resort and recently dropped by with my family to grab some brunch.  Simple enough, right?  Not quite.  We arrived and had to wait 20 minutes for a table despite the fact that the restaurant was barely a quarter full.  We were finally seated and decided to order off the menu since the buffet cost an outrageous $35/person.  Then came the 40 minute wait for our food.  Twice the wait staff tried to deliver the wrong food to our table, but the miscommunication didn't stop there.  When our food finally arrived, half of the orders were wrong.  When the correct food was finally brought out, three of the four dishes (two egg dishes and pancakes) were bland, dry and unappetizing.  Given that the fourth order was granola, I'd say that it was a pretty disastrous service.

We asked for the check, which arrived after ten minutes due to yet another miscommunication.  They comp'ed us an orange juice and a coffee, but with a service like that, two free beverages couldn't undo the damage from the rest of the meal.  I tipped out of pity more than gratitude.  

And as for the final time tally, we were there an hour and 20 minutes for a service that should have taken 30-40 minutes from start to finish.

If you're staying at the Bacara and are thinking of coming to Bistro - don't.  You're much better served by going somewhere local.",0

I have dealt with two unbelievable billing issues that the billing manager finally had to resolve and admit fault for twice in two years, but it took me days before she would get involved to resolve. In total, about 18 hours of my time, a humiliating office visit where I was refused cleaning for my children (again an admission of fault and accountability has been given to me for this by billing) because of a balance I had just been told about one day before (after over a year and visits in between). They tried to double bill me and insurance more than once in the past and admitted fault... At one point they sent me a packet with all billing information for me to handle it all on my own (their job and an in-network insurance-holding client) because the billing employee couldn't comprehend secondary insurance and coordination of benefits! She accused me of ""probably being on Obama Care"" because she couldn't figure her job out. (We have good insurance through my husband's employer, not government subsidized.) I was lied to by an incompetent in the same dept. who said I would be given time to review a bill (which I had yet to receive before the visit), and in front of my kids, the staff and about eight people in the office just hours later was treated like a deadbeat, criminal- client and refused service by a rude, powerless Doreen (office manager).

the decor was beautiful in a way.  their aesthetic seemed to be industrial and rustic, which is always a good combination for a wine and whiskey bar. but there were some sconces that were ill-placed, and too many light fixtures for a relatively small space. the table was cluttered by superfluous items;  one of these being a jar with beans and tea light candle that was not lit.

food wise - the boiled peanuts were a good idea, but were over-salted.  the bread served had a good flavor, but was flaky and a bit dry.  the grits were too salted and thoroughly inedible.  the pickled beets with the burger was undercooked, and the whole sandwich was again, too salty. the chips didn't seem home cooked, just store bought and sprinkled with paprika.

I find hard to follow 1000 words per minute, from an instructor randomly yelling at 25 people staggered in groups, with ""background"" music that plays louder than in a club. In addition, I cannot keep my workout quality high if I have to contemporaneously: monitor the heart rate, check the treadmill's settings/time/speed, jump frenetically from one exercise to the other and follow the instructions. 
I took one class: 25 people were divided in three rotating groups (treadmills; rowers; and body exercises). The instructor barely paid attention on how the body exercises were actually performed and I had to follow the images on a screen: why would that be any different from any work-out app? They present themselves as sort of personal trainer for large groups - if that can even be a thing - but no one really follows you during the exercises. There's nothing bad with that, but maybe it's just not worth the expense. If you need a personalized workout, the OT is not the right place. 
Lastly, I might sound like a granma, but (ugly) pop music was playing super loud and the A/C combined with fans everywhere froze all the sweat on my body. Notwithstanding the running, rowing and jumping, I was freezing like Leo in Titanic's final scene.

Our waiter was forgetful and not speedy at all. He asked for our drink order pretty fast but after that it was downhill.
My fiance ordered a Jameson and Canada dry... it took 9 min AFTER the bartender made it to receive the drink. At the end of the meal we needed boxes... took about 5 min for those. And we had to ask for the check!! We put our food in the boxes waited for 6 to 8 minutes and then he came back to take plates away, When he was walking away.. my fiance goes could we get the check too please?! He replies OH YEAH! ( like he'd forgot we needed to pay) 
The food was uhmmm.. Alright. I ordered the appetizer nachos and garden salad. The nachos were ok.. needed WAYYY more cheese, more chicken (and more guacamole, but I love guac) they weren't anything spectacular.
And salad was good ... as my daughter says

2275071,1,"LADIES, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME (and eventually money).

Went into Cabela's today for two reasons. I wanted to look over a Mossberg .308 I had been coveting from their store website (I never buy without actually placing my hands on and asking questions) and I wanted to look into buying a new bow. Not just one but BOTH of these counters were staffed by rude clerks who were incredibly unhelpful. 

At the gun counter I had to work extra hard to make eye contact with an employee even though he was not helping anyone else. For some reason he kept scanning the room above my head looking for literally anyone BUT ME to help. When it was finally obvious that I wasn't going away he rolled his eyes and brought out the rifle I wanted to see. (Honestly I was surprised at how light it was... after learning to shoot on much bigger - body not caliber- rifles the MVP LC almost feels too slim and delicate.) I had a TON of questions but it was obvious this store associate had very little interest in assisting me. I asked him if he had shot this particular rifle, and he said no. Which isn't a problem. But he was very terse and clipped with his sentences. Between the attitude and the eye-rolling and the impatient hissing between sentences I was beginning to wonder if I was actually speaking to a twelve year old girl as opposed to a full grown mature man. 

So I left. Thank you, no. I'll just buy my new rifle somewhere else. On to the archery department. 

Where I was again met with impatient rude customer service. Halfway through speaking with me (I wanted to take one of the bows into the range and get a feel for it) the associate WALKED AWAY!!! 

It was at that point that I realized what the problem was. They would have NEVER treated my husband with such blatant disrespect. Me, however? Well I am - and always will be - unapologetically female. Good enough to poke around in the pot and pan isle or to blow $300 on a pink cammo ""outfit"". But ladies, so far as Cabela's employees are concerned you are the cheerleader and never the hunter. The cook on a camp-out and a nuisance at the gun counter. 

After I complained to the manger (who's sole solution to the problem was ""Do you want me to go back there and re-introduce you to these employees?"" No. I don't. I don't want to be coddled. I don't want to be patronized. I want to shop, without the fact that I have a vagina being a deciding factor in whether or not I am treated like a person) I left. 

And I went to Scheels Sporing Goods in Sparks. Not only did I get the help I needed, I was given this assistance due to the fact that I was a human being. My femaleness never once entered into the equation. 

While in line I struck up a conversation with the woman ahead of me (we're just standing there, might as well be friendly).. and guess what? The eye-rolling and attitude was not just something I was privileged enough to experience. If you are female and have the audacity to wander out of the ""Home and Cabin"" section the Good Ole Boys manning the counters at Cabela's have a very special way of offering you service with a scowl.

Strip away the over priced fudge and the carnival atmosphere created by some lovely taxidermy work and one very sad, very dirty large fish-tank.. and all you have left is a limited selection of overpriced clothing, an even more limited selection of gear, and extremely rude service. In this way, Cabela's is the Walmart of the sporting goods world. Don't waste your time or the gas driving out there.",0

Long story short-after bringing our issues to the attention of the manager on site (no help), we found ourselves standing by the register trying to get our check so that we could leave.  It seems that even this little task was too much to ask for poor Franklin.  Some money was thrown on the counter (enough to cover our mediocre meal) and we left.  A phone call to ""Mark"" to inform him of our poor service took place.  We may or may not go back.  Which is a shame.  Schmooze is soooo close to home and we are always in the shopping center.

The maki rolls were not well-formed. Special rolls were smaller. There was very little eel in the Yellow Dragon roll. The Black Dragon had a bit more eel, but the roll was malformed, perhaps because it wasn't filled properly (almost like it had been rolled with too much empty space inside, and then collapsed).

Service was not good. It was difficult to get the attention of the staff the whole time we were there.  

There were also problems with payment. First, it was difficult to get her to give me the itemized receipt. When I finally got it, there was a mistake on it -- they had overcharged. I can't say whether it was a genuine mistake, but when you overcharge customers and make it difficult for them to see the discrepancy, that's definitely a service problem (at least).",0

I honestly, did not want to return there -even to get the right burger, choosing instead to just never, EVER return. The beef of the burger -yes, was cooked properly, however it had no flavour and was not even a pattie, it was crumbly and fell out when i tried to pick it up.

5713615,2,"I chose this restaurant to eat with friends, and I am so embarrassed that I made that mistake.

The service was AWFUL.  At first, I though the waitress was just being (poorly) cheeky when she mocked my friend for his order (he wanted fish cooked well done).  But no, she continued to be rude to him, and provide very careless, indifferent service to us.  The final straw was that the same friend's order took much longer to prepare, to the point that two of the people at our table were completely done with their main course before he even got served.  When he finally did get served, the fish was horribly undercooked.  The fish was sent back, and when it returned, it was cooked properly but was horribly bland.  At this point, everyone was done with his/her meal, so he had to eat bland fish alone.

The worst part was there was pretty much no apology to him for his delinquent meal other than to comment that it was his fault for ordering the fish medium-well.  Most restaurants that I have patronized with similar price points would offer to discount his soup (also inedible -- the gazpacho was drowned in vinegar) or to comp dessert after such a kitchen screw up.  But not here.  We got our full bill with very little kindness from the waitress and other staff.

As for the rest of the night, it was mixed.  My brother in law really enjoyed his fish dish.  My husband liked his steak.  I tried the Scottish salmon tartare (okay, definitely nothing that I'd order again -- the fried quail egg was rubbery, and the truffle oil overpowered the salmon), the pork belly (good, but I didn't like the lentils underneath or the accompanying brussel sprouts), and the fried green tomato salad (pretty good).

I cannot return to a restaurant with such blatantly rude service that charges $30+ for an entree.  For the same price, I could have received impeccable service and better food at Mise en Place.

The picture attached is of the meal before I touched it at all. This is what was given to me.

It clearly looks like the chef who put it together tried to make up for the fact that he didn't want to add the amount of unagi the previous chef did or even the amount he was supposed to.

I called the restaurant, and they confirmed he is a new chef and didn't add as much Unagi. He said ""Yes, it should have 12 pieces now"". I sent him a picture of my meal and asked him if he could find 12 FULL pieces of Unagi. 

He said no. 
Of course not, because there is MAYBE 6.

1964079,2,"When I say this place was too loud, I mean TOO LOUD!!!  Twice I asked if there was an outside table available, there wasn't, so we moved to a different inside table where the noise dropped maybe 2db. The waitress said it would get quieter when the live music stopped, and that was the only way we knew there was live music because you certainly couldn't hear it in the cacophony of LOUD VOICES!  The kind of loud where you can only see people's lips move and pretend you can hear what they're saying. The kind of loud that makes your nerves tense and puts you instantly on edge. 
I've been to ""Farm-to-Table"" restaurants before, but the menu at this one, at first glance, I thought there was nothing I wanted to eat on the menu. Three of us opted for pizza, the fourth ordered a burger. An hour later, a manager type came over and apologized for the delay and informed us everything was being plated. We were praying that the food was going to be fabulous after suffering so long with the noise. 
I ordered the Fungi Pizza, and when our server asked if I wanted to add Asparagus and Proscuitto to it, I accepted. When the pizza arrived it had a decent amount of Proscuitto, and was covered in Arugula. That was fine, I like Arugula and I like salad on pizza. I figured the server just mis-spoke when she said Asparagus, meaning Arugula. On my second slice of pizza I did get a bite of Asparagus though. I mention this because it was an up charge of $4 to add Asparagus and $4 to add Proscuitto. I won't go into my husband's meal because he is typically difficult to please when we dine out, but my son had the burger with a $4 egg on it (yuck) but he said it was delicious, ate half, then started having stomach cramps. I can't un-see the yolk running out of that bun, but that is personal preference. 
So bottom line, my Fungi Pizza was very tasty at $23. My son's burger was tasty at $21, but became regretful. Our server, Jenna, was VERY GOOD, the kitchen was slow, but it was the NOISE that marred the experience, and before the food ever arrived we knew we would never return to FarmKitchen Table.

I ordered one of the hashes with the corned beef and was disappointed to find that the beef was cooked in spices that tasted like allspice, not something I was expecting to find in my breakfast hash. The taste totally overpowered everything else on the plate. Knowing that I just hate that flavor, I gave the plate to my partner for eating, who can sometimes be a human garbage can. He thought it was inedible too, sadly. 

I ordered gravy on the side to taste and was similarly overpowered by the amount of pepper in the sauce. 

Last check against the breakfast was that the salad had balsamic vinegar on it, which I was not expecting on a breakfast plate with the other flavors in the hash. It was sort of strange and misplaced. 

It was an unhappy circumstance of being all of the flavors I hate the most combined with the cost of the meal (definitely not inexpensive). The portion was huge to give them credit but sort of inedible.",0

No one came by and asked if we wanted a drink or even acknowledge that we were there. Yes, we probably should have said something to someone, but I was so annoyed again and we just left. I am done giving this place chances to get their crap together. Each time I am left wondering why I want to waste my time and money with this establishment.",0

When I was finally helped I was told that my online order was never received and If I could place it at this time. I informed the employee I was supposed to be somewhere at 7:30 so I could not wait any longer and if I could be refunded. The employee was unable to help me with the refund and I was advised if I could come back at another date and show my receipt and get refunded. I was under the impression I was going to stop very quickly after getting off of work and get some fast dinner for my family. So not only did we end up having to come up with alterative last minute dinner arrangements late at night but I also already paid for this food and left with nothing. The employee I dealt with was polite and it did seem like he was dealing with slow internet connection or not enough staffing but this is not a way to do good business. I am disappointed with my service and would like this resolved and my debit card refunded immediately. My order # 2019320994.

Over half the tables were empty but was told a 5-10 minute wait... was sat a few minutes later by the waitress who was frustrated because she wasn't being sat and had two empty tables with a full waiting room. Ordered a simple breakfast and proceeded to wait a full hour for the food to come to the table. It was NOT busy. I counted 10 tables occupied on one side of the restaurant and only 1 of those tables had any food. Ridiculous to say the least.

477301,1,"I have extremely straight hair. Very easy to cut - no other hairdresser in my entire life has messed it up. Yet somehow. The woman who cut my hair at the chesterbrook hair Cuttery completely and utterly botched it. Could not have done a worse job. Hair is completely uneven in the back. I need to braid it for work, oh but I can't because of how uneven it is it falls out every time! If I could go back and undo a decision it would be when I decided to get my hair cut at hair Cuttery. VERY UNSATISFIED. I needed to go pay more money at another place just in an attempt to go get it fixed. And you might be thinking, what if she tried to cut layers? Well, my hair cutter asked me specifically if I wanted layers and I said to her very clearly NO. and then I proceeded talking to her about how layers didn't look good with my hair, and she was agreeing with me the whole time so there was no confusion. Do not go here if you want your hair to look good. If you want to never be able to style your hair the same again, go here.",0

3134012,1,"Walked in and saw that a couple of groups were waiting, walked up to the hostess table and waited almost 5 mins before anyone would even acknowledge that I was there. Said it was for two and they said it would be a 15 min wait. I said I would wait, but in the back of my mind I was wondering why so long with 6 open tables and 5 more that needed to be cleaned. More people came in after the two of us, we waited around 20 mins before I bugged on the of workers to be seated and he finally seated us and 4 more groups that came in after me. The server was nice but the first thing he said was that he was brand new, I have no problem with that but he was so new he should not have been by him self trying to help customers. After looking at the menu for around 5 mins he came back and took our orders and drink orders we got the drinks pretty quick, but kept waiting for our starter salads to show up and they never did. So after 20 of waiting for our salads to show up we decided to leave. I asked the server to speak with the manager and this woman comes to talk to me and I tell her the story why I was leaving, she then tells me if I leave she can't fix the wrong that has happened, and as she is telling me this a guy walks over with a name badge that says Restaurant General Manager. I think to my self okay now something is going to be fixed and during the whole conversation I have with the woman he doesn't say a word, not a apology for having to wait so long nothing. Anyway back to talking with the woman supervisor, I tell her I don't want to wait any longer and she then says ""well if you leave you'll have to wait longer to get food somewhere else"" so I tell her good bye and I leave to walk across the street to Texas Roadhouse. And had the best dinner I have had in months!! 

In conclusion if you are in this area never go to this restaurant if you want your food in a timely manner, the rgm and the supervisor are not good leaders and definitely are not good at customer service.

202912,1,"I cannot stress enough - MAKE SURE TO CHECK UNDER THE HOOD THAT EVERYTHING IS TIGHTENED BEFORE LEAVING THE LOT!

Two weeks ago while I was in NY my car won't start and I had to get it jumped. At that time, upon opening the hood, we noticed that the cap for where the antifreeze goes was left out and lying along the side of the well. I normally don't use the car unless for longer trips outside the area. I did however noticed that the fan stayed on even after turning the car off and locking it. I thought it was just Honda's way of keeping the car cool for idling.

And so I took the car to my mechanic only to be told that I would need a  new battery (because the antifreeze wasn't cooling off the radiator as it was supposed and the fan had to stay on to cool it, therefore draining the battery) and an antifreeze flush because sediments appear to have gone into the engine. 

I have not touched or brought the car anywhere else after the service at this location. On that day I was upsold to an antifreeze top off, which I accepted. Because of this, I am very disheartened as now I had to pay $250 for a new battery and the flush when all I needed was an oil change at the time!

After weeks of back and forth contact - the correction for leaving the antifreeze cap off causing a need for an antifreeze flush and a new battery? ""We would like to offer you one free Signature Service Oil Change for your vehicle to help conclude this matter."" 

Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to return because I don't know what else will be left uncapped the next time... possibly the engine oil??

This is possibly a one off, but one time is one too many. Please be cautious and double check guys. Maybe if I did, I wouldn't have found a need to write this review to warn others.",0

They were very rude and hung up on me. I called Livingsocial and they called them to let them know they had to honor the paid value since I never redeemed, they hung up on them as well. 

I was planning on going there regardless today even if I couldn't redeem my paid value but with that rude behavior I decided not to.

2099187,2,"I really wanted to like this place, and had heard so many great things I was really excited for my first time. However, I have to say I was disappointed in the taste of the food. Everything was just ok. 

We started with the Straciatella and the shaved brussel sprouts salad. The straciatella was good, probably the only really good thing to our meal. The bread was great, but I've had better at other Philly restaurants. I am a huge brussel sprouts fan but there was something weird with this salad, I had trouble finishing it. I was not a fan.

I then had the spaghetti and meatballs. I had heard so much about these meatballs I couldn't wait to try. They were big like everyone says but thats about it. The taste left something to be desired. I dont know but Ive had better frozen meatballs. The sauce on the pasta was just ok also, not sure why but I did not like it. I couldn't finish it. And I eat Italian food regularly, and always finish my plate. I am pretty easy to please with italian food, there was just some flavor in everything I tried, I did not like. Which was unusual. 

We then had dessert. The tiramisu was good. We had an apple thing that was just meh. The wine was good. But that's about it. Cute decor inside. Waitress was nice. However, I would not return.",0

1722349,1,"BEWARE BEWARE! If I could give this place 0 stars I would.

They told me it would be almost 200$ to cancel the reservation (even though my reservation was not for another month!) and this location was unwilling to help me. I told the representative not to cancel it because that is A ridiculous amount of money - who would cancel at that price? After hanging up the phone, I get an email stating that my reservation WAS in fact cancelled! Tried to call the manager MULTIPLE times at the Tampa location and kept being told that he would call me back in a minute but the call never came.

930825,2,"I have to say, that purchasing a car from this dealership was as expected and I had no real issues. I went to 4 other Nissan dealerships, and decided to purchase from them because I got the best price. However, I should probably mention here that my brand new car (2011 Altima) completely broke down on me within a week. Literally, only 6 days and 330 miles on the car. Apparently, the car's computer malfunctioned (this is how it was explained to me), but no one expects to have to have their car towed only 6 days after buying it brand new (OAN it totally made the tow truck driver's day. He said he'd never had to tow a truck with so few miles on it lol). I don't know if I can or should blame this dealer for this, but it seems there should be some sort of checks and balances in place to prevent this sort of thing. But I digress...

My experiences with the service department and body shop (that also services their other brands), has been less than stellar. I'll start with the body shop. It took 3 times longer than the initial quote for all body work to be completed (mind you, this was not a huge job and there was only one small minor dent and a few scratches to one section of the car). We're talking 3 weeks to get my car back. They provided very few updates about my car's status and I had to stalk to them find out when my car would be ready. 

Now onto the service department. They are fine for basic oil changes. They're not stellar in terms of getting the job done quickly, and I've waited as long as 3 hours but I tend to come on the weekends when they're busiest. Now, the major problem that I have had is that I have repeatedly had to come back to get my power outlets fixed. We're talking 7 times now. Each time, they want to blame my charger though I patiently explain that I've tried several different chargers all with the same result. The problem is clearly the car, but they always try to somehow make it my fault. The last time, they claimed that there were tiny earrings in the one of the outlets. Maybe so, but the fact that I've brought my car in several times for the same problem, and that only one of 2 outlets had earrings in them when both were broken, should have been a clue that there is something more going on here. The power outlet literally works for a week or so and then it blows and it won't charge anything. This is especially frustrating for me because I bought my car brand new, and so I don't expect to have these sort of problems when I only get my car serviced by them. A few of the times I brought my car in for the same problem, they have only fixed one of my power outlets though I tell them that both are not working. I've gone as far as to specify where the power outlets are and that each aren't working. It seems that the person checking me in is barely listening to me and so they miss important details and don't fix the entire problem. So my major problem with these guys is that they clearly aren't really fixing the problem. Each time I explain how many times I've been there for the same problem, and I get the vibe that I'm annoying them. 

I could go on...but I think I've hit the major points... If you can, get your car serviced elsewhere unless you like long waits, and having to keep coming back.",0

The thing that upsets me most isn't that its always so busy, but that the staff is indifferent and seemingly lazy. I blame bad management.",0
333317,1,"I can't even muster up a 2nd star for this place.  I like divey places with character, but they need something redeeming, like I don't know, good food?  

There is a saying that even bad pizza is good, but I think Black Thorn may have obliterated that saying sending ripples through space and time.  I've read reviews of people I trust on here that rave about this place.  People I know and trust, everything doesn't make sense, who is wrong here?  This may have been the worst pizza I have ever tasted!

I really don't like making one star reviews and it is subjetive, food that is, so this is just my opinion, nothing against the owners, they are obviously filling a need for pizza that I a lot of people love.  But I can point out so many things wrong with the pizza.  Like many have mentioned on here, this is not Chicao style.  I hate the pizza debate about New York, Chicago, thin crust, etc. I think they are all good if done well.  But Chicago style is not done well or correctly here.  It is not Chicago style, so don't call it that.  It makes us look like idiots around here.  The crust was a normal thin crust put in a deep dish, then a riduculous amount of cheese.  I think they put another crust on top then the toppings, then the sauce.  So it is a double decker?  The bottom crust was over done, the top dough was underdone.  The sausage and pepperoni were decent, but the sauce was horrid, what was not torched to a crisp in the oven.  It was so dry and the spices in it were so overwhelming.  But back to the structure of a Chicago style, should have an abundance of chunky tomatoe sauce.  This was just typical sauce, very little at that, but again, evaporated in the oven.  I seriously just picked apart one piece of pizza and that is it.  

We also got the thin crust, better, but believe it or not, this one was under cooked.  The bottom of the crust was all white and flimsy.  Nothing stood out about the flavor or appearance.  I forgot to mention we ordered salads because of the the hour and a half ETA.  Ugh, was that just oil on the salad?  They could have just put any vinegarette on there and it would be fine, but the dressing was gross.

So like I mentioned, it was 1 1/2 hours for the pizza and I really can't complain because they do set that expectation, but why so long?  It wasn't that busy.  No one clears your table here and you have to go up to the bar to order everthing.  Not in a good way like some self service restaurants.  Just kind of a weird place, nothing impressive about it.  Even down to the sparse dollar bills on the ceiling.  As if they thought about how cool it would be to have the ceiling covered in bills, but it just never caught on, so there is maybe $77 on the ceiling.  Just an odd place, I think I'll go to Little Caesar's next time.",0

6696565,1,"I'm starting off stating that I'm truly Italian. Born and raised in Italy, so I know what a truly Italian pizza looks and tastes like. So, we got there and the inside of the restaurant was very dark, and our waitress was very insisting, rude and impolite. We ordered our pizza. We got the Margherita. We pronounced it the Italian way, of course, but she didn't understand and continued asking us to repeat. She finally understood and placed the order. The pizza arrived. Please, PLEASE, don't put ""Parmesan"" on the Margherita pizza. Just don't. It's so wrong. If you want to get through as an authentic Italian pizzeria, you MUST get at least the Margherita right. Come on. Other than the ""Parmesan"" on our pizza, the pizza crust was okay, the tomato sauce needed to be a little more cooked and less liquid. The mozzarella and the basil were also okay. Furthermore, the *pizze* were tiny!!! They were so small!!! It was so funny! They are not worth the money! 
After we finished our pizza, the waitress kept insisting on dessert. We were tired of her asking, so we finally ordered a Tiramisù, a ""Vanilla Bean"" ice cream and a ""Chocolate Hazelnut"" ice cream. 
The Tiramisù wasn't good at all. Just no. It felt like they bought it from the supermarket, and it was so off. 
The same thing for the ice cream. You cannot write that you serve ""Gelato"" if you actually serve ice cream. THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. If you want to be seen as an authentic Italian restaurant, first of all don't write ""Vanilla Bean"" or ""Chocolate Hazelnut"", write it the Italian way ""Vaniglia"" and ""Cioccolato"". But I also understand that maybe you didn't want to fool your customers by letting them think that it was actually ""Gelato"" while it really wasn't. They were okay, but I had already tasted them when I personally bought them at Publix (you know what I mean?) SO NOT worth the $6 each. 
Also, if you want to be seen as an Italian restaurant, please get employees that speak Italian and that will greet you with a beautiful ""Buon giorno"" or ""Buona sera"".

While your candlelit ambiance is as darkly romantic as a seance in a rustic outpost from the Civil War, and your drinks are something stellar - the Coffee in Heaven is a veritable alcoholic blend of coffee and chocolate and a frothy egg white for added creaminess, and the Cockaigne is delightfully sour and fizzy - the rest of you has left me yearning for something more...something like PZAZZ. 

The Duo of Elk - cooked mid rare like all meat should be - was as boring as meat and potatoes....because literally, that's all it was: tough meat and potatoes. What is impressive about this dish, however, is that you get to pay a whopping $32 for something similar in taste, texture and portion size you could have bought for $3.20 and microwaved for 30 seconds.

I was so hungry when I got it yesterday. There is still half a slice left in my fridge. This pizza made my appetite dry right up. I'll throw out those empty and flavorless calories tomorrow. 

Pity Pasta Plus wasn't enforcing mask wearing for government employees. One gentleman whom I had seen across the street when I conducted business a few minutes earlier talked to me for a minute or two as he wanted in line to order and only put his mask on to talk to the cashier.

2809833,2,"NOPE! This hotel was booked to full capacity on 8/8, there was no social distancing. I could hear the neighbors in room 204. Continental breakfast is lean due to COVID-19. I checked in at 2045, there is no airport shuttle available due to the pandemic. Gotta get a taxi or ride share from the airport. 

The hotel is dated as well as the room. I did not see any USB outlets anywhere, toilet seat was loose and the TV remote needs to be replaced. The room is basically a time capsule from the '80's. 

The bathroom amenities were not for one time use. No one should have to use a giant pump bottle to get shampoo, body wash & conditioner.",0

The sushi quality is the worst I have ever had! The texture of the fish seems to be old and soggy. Had no flavor. The tuna tasted the same as the salmon and yellow tail and vice versa. The rice was also poorly prepared. The rice was hard and chewy. I highly suggest not coming here for your sushi. Your better off going to another place.",0
5960337,1,"This company is by far the worst company ive ever had to deal with.. First of all when we moved in the realtor was sooooo unprofessional that he made the previous tenants post it on craigslist and find a new tenant all while he sat on his a** and got paid for nothing. We moved in the home the very next day after the previous tenants so did the home get properly cleaned and infected, no. The fire alarm was still hanging from the ceiling... we never really needed much but one time we needed both sinks fixed and some lady came in and fix one but made an excuse about the other so she wouldnt have to REALLY fix it. The owner of the home says we needed to put a $1350 deposit because we dont have a long renting history- no problem. So finally we move out and getting the home a $900 cleaning job to ensure we would get our full deposit back. But of course two months after movingnout we get a check for $600. We were livid as you can imagine. Caliber shows us a breakdown of costs and we see they seperately charged EVERYTHING thing they did to a door that needed replaced and then a $200 labor fee (double charging) and then the HOLLOW BATHROOM DOOR WAS $230.. Wtf?!? who in their right mind would think thats okay?! Not to mention the $170 charge for landscape for a backyard the size of my fist. We reached out and got attitude of course so I contacted the founders of Caliber who forwarded my message to a lady names Wendy. Thinking okay thats nice they responded to me but that was just to find Wendy telling me that nothing could be done because thats what the owner wanted to charge. im sorry but why the f*** are you involved if all these decisions are the owners?! I want to advise evryone to stay FAR away from this company unless you like throwing away money. The fact that this company can change their name and continue giving the same POS service disqust me. I will be taking legal action on them for all those people that got screwed!!!",0

When I tried to place a to go order, the muscular female bartender/waitress informed me it would back up the kitchen.

She treated me like an imbecile for wanting to do takeout lunch on Monday November 28, 2011 at 1:15. Note it was only 2 po boys. It's not like I was ordering for a whole office. Truth be told, she only wanted dine in customers because they would buy drinks and increase her tip. I was not even occupying a table. I was sitting by myself at the bar. She insisted on me understanding how busy the restaurant was and how much 2 shrimp po boys would back up a kitchen. When I told her I didn't understand her irrational and illogical point, she spoke slower to clarify her moot point.

2105104,2,"I hadn't been to a subway in years, but this one is close to my house, and I'd recently gotten some coupons in my mail box.  I knew I'd be working some late nights, so I stuck them in my car.  Much to my surprise, though, when I swung in for a quick sandwich on my way home one night...  The Subway staff at this Subway location explained to me that they don't take Subway coupons.  Uhh  what?  Actually, it wasn't so simple as that.  They explained they would accept a coupon, but only for the most basic of sandwich, (one basic meat, one basic cheese, lettuce/tomato/onion for the veggies), and I'd have to buy a drink and chips too.  Honestly it would've come off better if they'd just said something like they were sorry but they just weren't set up to take coupons.  
I'll give them two stars instead of one because they were fast, and the service was friendly, (the gal was downright cheerful as she explained that if I wanted to use a coupon I'd get the most bare bones sandwich they could make, and I'd also have to buy chips and a drink with it.)  But, honestly, I'm not gonna be back.  Subway's nothing more than mediocre fast food-style subs to begin with, which is fine if the price is right.  But, unless you're using a coupon, or taking advantage of a special...  They're really not much, if any, cheaper than a sandwich from a better quality, not fast-food, shop.  (Not to mention the locally distributed, but not honored, coupons just come off as a scammy way to get you in the door.)  There's some amazing sandwich shops in town, go a little further afield and get a better sandwich for around the same price.",0

2181343,2,"My husband and I were delighted to hear about a James Beard Award winning restaurant that happens to be in Nashville.  This restaurant serves ""rustic"" Italian, and you have to make reservations because this place gets packed.  We wanted a Saturday reservation but the only opening they had was at 9:00 PM, so we opted to do a Sunday dinner instead.  Little did we know, the menus change on Sunday.  Our sever informed us that they don't offer pasta on Sunday, yet a few customers sitting at the bar had pasta on their tables. (Whatever..fine)  The Sunday menu consists of a few pizzas, meatballs, and a few appetizers.  That sucked, but we were still game to eat.  To start, I ordered their pork cracklings.  It was pretty good (that's why they got 2 stars instead of 1)  My husband ordered their meatballs which our waitress raved about.  The order consists of 3 decent sized meatballs, and I ordered their ""pork belly"" pizza.   
     My husband said the meatballs were pretty tasty, but not enough to make him come back for it.  I know his dish was less than $15 but more than $10, and my pizza was $18.  We don't mind paying ""X"" amount for a meal, but if a pizza is going to be more than $10 (some else said) than the ""[pizza] fairy better be dancing on my tongue.""  My pizza was such a disappointment.  A few people mentioned something about adding an egg on top, but our server didn't mention that. (It must not be ""available"" on Sunday)  In addition, I don't think an egg could save the pizza I had.  If ""bacon"" doesn't fix it, nothing will.  The dough looked thin which I like, and I was expecting it to be crispy.  Instead it was the opposite :(  It didn't have any sauce which I know not all pizzas ""require"" a sauce, but it needed something, and there was little pork belly on the pizza.  If I picked off all the bacon, and lined them up side-be-side, the size would equate to 1/4 of a regular slice of bacon (I'm not kidding). I basically paid for cheesy bread with a sprinkle of bacon.  Next, desert.  We ordered their corn-meal pound cake, with fruit, homemade ice-cream, and whipped cream ($10-$14).  Sounds tasty right?  Our server said the cornmeal was just for texture.  When we ate it, it tasted exactly like sweet corn-bread with fruit preserves and ice-cream :( The ice-cream was the star of the show.
     Not only was the food disappointing but so was our service.  We literally had the ""dinning"" experience (i.e. we were there for more than 2 hours).  Our server forgot about us.  How do I know?  Everyone sitting at the tables around us, came in after us, yet they got their pizzas and/or order before us.  When my pizza came out, it was ""cool."" The cheese wasn't stringy, and the cheese started getting that ""skin"" because it was getting cold :(  I didn't complain because having to wait an hour and 15 minutes for my dinner = I'm pretty hungry.  She never came by to tell us why we had to wait so long, or why the people that came after us started eating before us.  As I mentioned earlier, if I didn't have the cracklings to start off with, this place would've received 1 star.",0
2786747,1,"Belle Meade's mansion tour caters to the kind of American who would like to look upon this era as ""the good old days.""

When I arrived the Jubilee tour was full, so my friend and I went on the mansion tour. I thought it was strange that these two tours should be separate in the first place- I thought, surely there aren't separated tours for people who are willing to engage with slavery, and people who don't want to think about it?

That is exactly the case. Everything about the tour is designed to skirt around the issue as much as possible. The time period BMP chose to recreate is immediately following the civil war, which apparently gives the tour guide license to refer to recently emancipated slaves as ""employees"" who ""chose to return"" following the war. There is absolutely no mention of the reality of that ""choice"" for these former slaves who had no money, no connections, no education, and no other options?

The owners of the plantation are never once called what they were: SLAVERS. The tour guide talks about the patriarch who ""oversaw the construction of the house""- not who ""forced by violent means human labor"". The tour guide even has the gall to refer to ""the process of bringing workers into the property"" - AKA THE SLAVE TRADE. 

BMP, you do an incredible disservice to the generations of humans who were subjugated and dehumanized on your land. You choose to make tourists feel at ease in romanticizing an era of horrifying human atrocity over honoring the lives of the people who suffered there. Do better for them.",0

6150572,2,"After a weekend in Santa Barbara, my girlfriend and I decided to wander down State street for some Sunday brunch before we left the city. This place seemed popular and looked interesting so we decided to give it a shot.  That was a mistake...
While the menu had a nice spread of options, it took over twenty minutes for us to get a server to take our drink order. This first impression didn't sit well with us, but we knew the rush was ending so we decided to let it go and enjoy our time there. 
Soon enough, we had to flag down a server to take our order.
About 10 minutes later a different server walked over and dropped off a plate of what looked like half eaten food (sort of like a bread plate but it wasn't). There were literally two pieces of pie, a few pieces of old bread, sticks of butter and crumbs all over the plate. It honestly looked as if the server had removed it from a table who didn't finish it and left it with us...disgusting!
When the food that we actually ordered came out, I sent that left over plate away. Our food was pretty good and that is why this post isn't getting a one star rating.  However, the service never got any better, in fact it got worse. Never once during our meal did a server come ask us how our food was or if we wanted more drinks, we even had to flag someone down for the bill so we could leave.  
Overall it was a waste of time and money. There are so many more great places to eat around here, pass on this one.",0
935366,1,"There is a sign in the window advertising gluten free pizza. This afternoon I wanted something different and have been wheat-free. I called and ordered the gluten free pizza and was given the price, which I thought was surprisingly comparable to a regular pie. I should have known it was too good to be true.

When I got there to pick up, I waited patiently for someone to decide to come to the counter, which took longer than it should have considering I was the only person there waiting. I was then given a small pizza box. I figured the pizza might be smaller, but still fair with leftovers for two people. But when I picked up the box I realized how light it was; and when I opened the box I was incredibly disappointed at what was definitely no more than a ""personal"" sized pizza. That may have been my fault, but no one asked me what size pizza I wanted when I called to order, and most places around here don't offer a personal size. $13 for a personal sized pizza? For real?

Size aside, the pizza itself was awful. The crust was both dry and gummy, if that's even possible. The bottom was dry - not a nice thin crust and the layer above it was gummy. When the cheese came off the pizza, the sauce went with the cheese - nothing stayed on the crust. The pizza itself had little taste and left an odd aftertaste in my mouth. The weirdest pizza I've ever had.

Very disappointed, all around - from price to size to quality of product. I definitely won't be going back.",0

The tapenade was very olive based and I don't like olives. (love olive oil though). It was a good concept just not for me. The pizza we ordered was tasty, the ""when in rome."" I had issues with it. Way too much arugula on top and that made for a bitter pizza.

The gulch nail bar had good reviews and they did the nail dipping so I thought I would try it out. When I walked in the place looked nice and I was warmly greeted. I picked out 2 colors and he began to prep my nails. He asked me which color and I asked for one nail to be a different color. His exact words were ""ok that's easy"" I had a grey color for my nails and one blue. When he was putting a top coat on the grey he kept looking at it funny as the color was changing. I didn't think anything of it. When the lady came over she was talking to him. At this point he was done and she asked if I liked it and I said yes. She explained the grey was mood changing and that it may change a little. I told her I just want it to be grey. She said it will stay that color unless I get really warm or cold like putting my hand in water. I don't know what water had to do with mold changing but I agreed as long as they were grey most of the time. He told me my total was $45. I said ""wasn't it suppose to be $40"" he said you got two colors so that's an extra $5. I have NEVER been charged for two colors unless it was a design, and that would of been nice to know instead of just saying that's easy. When I left I noticed throughout the day my nails were a light blue. I tried putting them under water and they never changed. I found it hard to believe that a powder could be mood effected. I called and asked her if I could have the color changed. Her response was that she asked me if it was ok when I was her and that it would of been easier to fix then. When she asked me that earlier they were already done so I don't know how it would of been easier. I also told her that color was suppose to stay mostly grey like she said and t hasn't been that was since I left. She told me to come back and told me it was going to take a long time and be so hard (maybe her employee should of asked why the color was being weird while he was putting it on since he seemed so confused) when I got there she was rude and rough on my hands. It was a very easy fix. Just filed down and redipped. They new color I got after asking for grey still wasn't grey (it was dark green) but I wasn't going to say anything again. She did tell me that the nail swatches never match the actual color. Probably something they should tell customers. My nails hurt so bad after from her filing so hard. Just 2 weeks later they were lifting and chipping. I was so unhappy with my experience and I won't be back.",0

I tell the guy (who looks like he rolled out of bed 5 minutes ago) in the front I have an appointment and give them my name. Well he informs me with a rude attitude that he can't find it. Basically telling me that I'm lying and I can have a seat until someone can take care of me.

The actors relied much to heavily on touching people as opposed to actually attempting to scare people. The atmosphere was cool, just for the fact that it is an old penitentiary. However, the attractions were mediocre at best. It seems as if you are getting a good deal because there are 6 attractions. However, each attraction only takes 3-4 minutes to go through.

If you look, most of the one and two star reviews are from people that live in Nashville or a nearby southern city. Probably their reasons for low reviews are similar to mine, they have seen a beautiful, and one of the last truly unique downtown areas, become homogenized by investors that rushed in to capitalize on a booming market.

This has been a trend for a while, they open a location with a southern/county name and theme, throw together a menu with some poor imitations of southern food, and bilk as much money out of tourists, with their watered down drinks and crappy food.

I actually worked on the construction of Acme feed and seed, and looked forward to going there, I had high hope this place would break the downward spiral trend Nashville has been going through... nope, Acme Feed & Seed is, by far, the worst case of restaurant fraud in Nashville.

I waited in a long line to get in, and then had my ID checked by a guy, who's attitude suggested he was doing me favor by letting me through the door. We then waited like vultures along the wall for a space to open up. We finally were lucky enough to get a hard wooden bench in front of a cappy little coffee table to eat from.

The drinks were 95% ice cubes, expensive, and took about three sips to drink.
The food was mediocre.
The all three levels were blaring music, but different songs. It was so loud that we had to shout in each other's ear just to hear each other.

You'd think he'd have someone around more qualified than us to help make sure the dog doesn't jump off the table and break a leg.)

When we asked about separation anxiety he didn't even ask us to elaborate on what our dog's symptoms were. He just told us that it could be fixed with training. When I asked for examples, he screamed, "" PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. PAY SOMEONE TO COME TRAIN YOUR DOG."" He's an ass hat and I'll never again pay him a dime to treat any of my animals.

5880899,1,"I enjoy seeing movies on Sunday mornings when the crowds are small unfortunately I will not be coming back to Galaxy in Sparks for they do not sell coffee and the horrendous customer service that I received today 03JAN.

Last Sunday I was informed that they do not sell coffee so I brought my own coffee but was told to leave it at the ticket stand when I asked for a Manager I was greeted with eye rolls and   the low guttural tone of ""ugghhhhh fine"" At this point all the employees proceed to stop working and gather to watch the showdown. I was greeted by a middle age manager that looked as though he had been heavily drinking the night before, unshaven, dirty wrinkled shirt and that stale casino smell. Yummmm! He proceeded to tell me that outside food and drinks are not allowed. Okay! I can live with this except that Galaxy does not sell coffee and I would like coffee and there are no beverages that can be substituted for coffee, I don't mind paying $5 for a coffee just sell the damn thing!!! When confronted with this information he informed me that they used to sell coffee but it did not sell. Cool. Then let me take my coffee and watch the movie. No. His brain was overwhelmed and begun to repeat the line we used to sell coffee but no one would buy, seeing as this was going no where and customer service is not their priority I left the coffee and proceeded to my broken sticky seat helped along by a moronic pimple faced staff that can't keep their hands out of their pants.


In short:

Con's
Poor customer service
Poor hygiene performed by staff
Poor cleanliness of property
High pressure sell tactics by staff
Moronic staff
Expensive!!!
Broken ""rewards system""
iPhone app that is consistently on the fritz

Either train your staff to pretend to enjoy their jobs or don't hire someone who cannot perform any level of decent customer service.
Two of your female employees gave us the most disgusted looks when we said ""we're still waiting on our hash browns."" That's all that was said, & I said it in a very polite tone. I wasn't upset at all nor did we wait long for our hash browns. She just handed us the bag, we looked in it, realized the hash browns weren't in there, & told her about them. Her & the girl behind her both proceeded to give us such mean looks with their chin held high & their eyes low. They gave us that look for about 4 intimate seconds before turning around to check on the hash browns. I'm no expert on customer service but you do NOT treat someone with that level of indecency regardless of who it is ! I understand you probably hate your jobs, but there is no one else to blame for where you're at in life other than yourselves. If you knew how to act & complied with the rules of basic customer service, maybe you could get another job besides fast food or Walmart. But until you fix that shameful attitude, you'll be at the drive through window for the rest of your life. I can only imagine how hard it must be for you to land a better job. No actual employer would hire an attitude like that. You'll never have an office job, a banking job, none of that. You'll learn quick that that smug face won't land you any success in life.

Heat exchanger $3498 (if not under warranty any more and available)

He just kept talking and talking.  Told ""technician"" I am very direct, hired him to tell me the problem, what it would cost in time and money to fix. He would not answer my direct yes/no questions. 

The Horizon Services technician told me he found me crass.  

I told him if he was going to insult me in my own home he could leave, he did not leave.  

I repeatedly asked for the model # of the heater, at least five times.  It took him 20 minutes to read it to me (I timed it) and only did because I asked again.

Interrupted me as I was speaking several times, even after I brought it to his attention, in an attempt to distract me from my valid concerns.  

Totally disregard for me, my questions and that he was in my home at my request because I was considering hiring him to fix the heater. 

I wanted him to leave, instead he spent an hour writing up paperwork for a job Horizon will never get.  

My sense is this is how Horizon Services trains their people - to run their own high pressure sales agenda (used-car dealer style) focused on getting the most money possible out of their victims instead of listening to the customer and meeting their needs.

On Sunday it's a fixed menu and you don't know what is on the menu until the plates come out and it's family style. Our first big plate was cured meats and cheese with bread and olive oil with a dollop of cheese in the middle. That was delicious. Definitely thought the starter was a good indicator of what was to come. We were ready for the following plates. The second dish was the meats, which was full of grill pork chops, beef, sausages, and chicken doused with tomato sauce. Lots of tomato sauce. So much sauce that you can't really tell what meat you're eating by looking at it. This was super salty and it was just a huge pile of meat. I guess if I were taken by terrorists and held captive I would appreciate this, but it wasn't a lovely sight. My table full of asians AND photographers didn't even take a picture of it. At the same time, a plate full of pasta which included bucantini, penne, and lasagna. The next plate was an arugula salad with a light vinaigrette dressing. Although after all the salty meats and pasta sauce, the salad was a good break. The dessert plate included a pistacchio cheesecake, tiramisu, and a dense chocolate cake.

We would have a cooler or two of beer, drinks. The afternoon staff would go so far as to bring us plastic cups for our bottles / cans. As the evening shift made the rounds, we were not allowed to have coolers, or our 'personal alcohol', as it was referred to. Talk about mixed signals......
The night security guy....the individual with the Scottish accent and meaningless badge on his belt, treated a group of like children. He went so far as to make us open our cooler in an outdoor seating area.....which legally, he probably wasn't allowed to do. 

Why were we allowed to drink a few beers of our own poolside during the day, but on the verge of a call to the police that same evening for doing the same exact thing?

Meanwhile, at the pool that same afternoon, a group of young ladies started smoking marijuana. Our group had 30 kids at the pool....and our group had to tell the ladies to cool it....not the staff.

The hotel has been very good to us in the past, but my organization will probably book our block of rooms elsewhere next year to avoid this confusion....

One of the female staff members at the front desk, not sure of her name, but she wore a bun in her hair this past weekend was down right nasty and rude......

The place is huge and confusing.  We stayed on one end but had to work at a convention on the other end.  It took us a good 10-15 minutes to get there.  The convention center is amazing, it is huge!  It was nice to be able to stay so close to where we'd be working.

The place is filled with fake trees that kind of have that nice plastic smell.  The roof is glass making you think you are outside, which is pretty but it made us a bit crazy and we needed to step outside which was an ordeal since every entrace was filled with smokers so we had to walk down a bit to get real fresh air.

Food was terrible, not sure if it was from my company's planning or the place itself but you would think something so big would be prepared for many types of diets.  I'm vegetarian and at each lunch I'd ask for something without meat and they would refer me to someone on the table that really had meat.  They'd say try the potato salad (it had ham inside), try the green beans (it had bacon all over it), try the salad (more bacon tossed in the lettuce).  The restaurants were crowed and not worth the wait.  Everyplace had a 2 hour wait.  

The best thing was the Jack Daniels saloon where we found a very entertaining local band that was there almost every night.  It was fun but very crowded.

I took pictures of the purse before I dropped it off and it was not like that before. I kindly asked them to untwist it and fix it and the guy was extremely rude and disrespectful to me and claimed he 'didn't have time to mess up the metal links'. Clearly he wants to hear what he wants because the metal links has nothing to do with my issue. This guy needs to work in the back in isolation and never interact with customers. He's unhappy with his own life so he will give you attitude for no reason. He's immature and very disrespectful and has no idea how to act like an adult. Save your money and go to another shop! Do not go here! You will also notice there are several reviews of his horrible service.,0

Other than that, this place deserves a zero simply because of the horrible job. The customer service portion was fine. It was simply the poor nail work that is what made this a bad experience. Some of my nails are square, some of them are round, others are sqaure-oval. When she asked me if I want to cut my nail down, i said yes. She started drilling them down and didn't ask how short. Then showed me one nail and said okay? So i said okay because it's not like she was going to go back and add another nail. Some of my nails do not have an apex, if you know about nails you know they need an apex and it will prevent them from breaking. When I say no apex I mean the nail is FLAT. Nails have a natural curve from side to side, well not these because she didn't go along the natural curve. So some of them look flat and wide. Total disappointment. Never again, even if it was free the next time.",0
1116127,2,"I came here with a group of friends on a Sunday night. My Grandparents loved this place back in the day, but I think the food quality has diminished since.

The entrees come with a forgettable salad (chopped lettuce and some shredded carrot thrown on top...not even a tomato? Seriously?) and a soup, which tasted ok, but it just seemed like it was straight from the can. The garlic bread was AMAZING! 

I went all out and ordered the tortellini with scallops and shrimp, (I'm usually a basic pasta kinda guy when I'm out to eat at Italian Restaurants) so I was excited for my entrée to come. When it came out, to my surprise, the scallops were the size of my thumb nail! They should have clarified that they were BABY scallops on the menu, not just scallops. I was super mad. Not only that, but they were overcooked, rubbery and tasted funky. The shrimp was also tough. Sauce was a cream base tomato sauce, which was good. Pasta was good as well. 

The service was good. Everything came out on time and our waters were never empty.

Cortardo's can be summed up as:  Forgettable food, good service, BYOB , With Amazing garlic bread. I cant see myself going back here....Well, maybe for the garlic bread.",0
2154655,2,My review is about the restaurant that they have. We were some what hungry and we decided to eat there because my husband had to check out a gun so we thought that we should have lunch. We ordered a hamburger it came with fries and a drink. When we received our order we had more bun than burger. The burger was so thin and we barely found the lettuce and tomatoes. The fries were tasty but we wanted a burger and not get filled up with fries.  I gave them 2 stars because it came with a drink. I think with all the money Cabelas makes they would at least offer a juicy big burger.,0

In about 15 minutes one of the employees walks out and tells everyone that they were taking all the systems down for 15 minutes.

146227,1,"I decided to try this place for the Valentine's Day event they were having. The live jazz music was amazing however the food and service was horrible. I paid 100 dollars for the event (50 per person) and although I was refunded 48 dollars for the meal it still did not make up for my ruined Valentine's Day evening. The event was a dinner and concert, the dinner included appetizer, entree, and dessert. I arrived at 4pm for the event and although there was a large crowd I did not expect to have to wait 2 1/2 hours just for my appetizer! I did not receive my first dish until 6:45. Our waitress forgot to put in the order and by the time our entree came out they had ran out of the side dishes for my entire tables meal. Instead of informing us that they had ran out of some of the side dishes, they decided to bring me beans, I guess thinking I wouldn't notice it was not the macaroni I ordered. The assistant manager attempted to have the cook make me some last minute macaroni but it looked nothing like what was on the plates I had seen earlier, I was given bow tie noodles with what tasted like whipping cream and some shredded cheese. The food did not have the New Orleans flavor whatsoever, I know from experience it. I order fried chicken and received grilled instead. I order sausage and chicken gumbo, and received seafood gumbo instead.  I was so looking forward to the beignets for dessert and of course they ran out of that as well. I normally never like to complain about a restaurant but my experience was so disappointing. I ate nothing that night, aside from a few spoonfuls of the gumbo until I realized it was seafood.  I wanted a refund for the food portion of my purchase because not only was my food late but I did not receive anything I ordered because they ran out of it. I felt that a refund or at least some sort of gift certificate should have been offered to me, I should not have had to have a 30 minute conversation with an assistant manager explaining why I was displeased. It should be obvious when your kitchen has run out of the menu items. The sad part was none of the wait staff came to check and follow up to even realize we hadn't received our meal, I had to find a manger myself. Overall, a very sad evening. I really enjoyed the Jazz performance but the poor service and food really outweighed the good. I hope that if they do this event again they will plan better in order to make sure we are getting our money's worth.  I appreciate my refund but I really would've preferred the romantic evening and great food that was advertised.",0

I only went here tonight because my best friends father decided to have his birthday party here. I have actually been here once before and I despised the experience. This night was just as bad. 

The service was alright, we had one waitress and there were 20 people in our group. Nobody helped her out and I feel like she was pretty overwhelmed by all of us. But she operated okay given the circumstances.

The food was terrible! Everything was bland,flavorless, and just gross. The crabcakes tasted like crap instead of crab. The bourbon street chicken had been sitting out too long. The mashed potatoes had lumps. The salad bar was pretty sorry too. I promise you that the ingredients were not fresh. Overall the food was gross and tasteless.

The restaurant itself was nasty. I understand the fact that the place was packed with people but they should have had at least one person cleaning up. The restaurant had lots of people tripping over themselves to grab food. It was a real cluster Fuck trying to get by people who jump in and out of your way just to grab one thing. My biggest pet peeve is when I saw some kids touching the food at the buffet with their bare hands and then leaving it there. Not a very sanitary thing I happen to witness.  After what I witnessed tonight I don't think I want to go back there anymore.

This collision center was recommended by the insurance company and was said to have great reviews. I made an appointment and got my car fixed. The day I picked it up, I noticed there was a small bubble-like thing on the panel they were fixing. I brought it up to Steve and he said that there must have been gas or small particles under the clear coat that caused it to burst. He said it was their fault and they would call me to have it fixed. When I got home I did a walk around my car and noticed damage that was not previously on my car. There were scratches on the bottom of the back right door, a chip and dent on the left back door, a broken lining on my fender, etc. I went back to Caliber Collision to talk to Luis (the Geico representative) to show the damage. When I had originally gone to caliber, the did a walk around my car and marked all the prior damage on a paper. All the damage that I noticed after I picked up my car was not recorded on that paper. Luis and Steve talked for a while and looked at the damage. Luis said that the insurance would cover fixing the original work that caliber had to do. Steve rudely said that they would see if they could fix the damage that they did only if we let them do the work. I obviously did not want them to work on my car and said no. Steve was very rude (along with the other workers at Caliber Collision) and continued to say how their work was good.

3397560,1,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times over the past 18 months but never again. The hotel is in a great location and the employees are attentive and provide good service. 

The issue is with the facility. There has been numerous times where I felt that the hotel was poorly maintained...from cooling to elevators. However last night I encountered a first in my 25 years of traveling. Because the room was hot I requested a fan but when it arrived the deadbolt on my door was stuck and I literally could not get out  

It took the maintenance team 30-40 minutes to get the door opened and they literally had to ""break in"" to the room (see attached pic).  They were ill equipped to open this room and did not have the tools or expertise to open this door. My comment to them was it was a good thing there was no medical emergency or fire or I would have been dead. 

Interestingly this morning in the executive lounge another guest was talking about this very thing happening to him this morning. Almost the exact same scenario. This is not a coincidence ...clearly they have maintenance issues. 

I checked out of the hotel (8/27/19) and will never stay there again. The Sheraton waived the room charge but that is a small consolation considering this situation.

6780948,1,This has been the absolute worst experience of my life.  I felt pressured to trade my car in from the very beginning and they made promises that they did not keep.  I'm now in debt with my credit score lowered because of these men.  If I would have known they weren't going to follow through with what they originally promised me I would have not traded in my car.  Now the general manager is denying everything he and the salesman promised. I hired an attorney and the general manager instead of resolving the situation offered me a bribe to delete my negative reviews.  Please do not fall for their empty promises because they don't care if they ruin your credit.,0
348564,1,"Bistro La Baia had the WORST COSTUMER SERVICE OF MY LIFE. The hostess was rude and spoke abrasively towards us the second we stepped in the door. Our twelve person party was cramped in the space that a normal restaurant would seat four people in. The restaurant was so crowded, it probably exceeded the legal capacity. When I got out to go to the bathroom, it was a huge ordeal since it was so crowded. When I tried to return to my seat, there was a waiter standing in the small path to my seat, so I waited. But while I was waiting a different WAITER PUSHED ME out of the way so he could pass by. While I was eating, there was no room on the table because they crowded us into such a small area, so I had to hold a plate in my left hand while I ate with my right hand. When one of my friends and I went to tell our waiter (I think he was also the owner) our concerns, he began to YELL AT US before we could even finish and he continued until we walked away. Even after we left, he continued to yell about us to another waiter and we could hear. On the way out, my friend told the waiter that he would write a bad review on Yelp, and the waiter responded yelling, ""OH you go write your review. Whatever,"" and started mocking him. I was already upset with the bad service, but to completely not care about your customers and their concerns, is completely unacceptable. Never go to Bistro La Baia if you wish to be treated with even a sliver of dignity. And the food was barely mediocre.",0
158675,1,"The price went up and the quality of food went down. Not to mention the service. We had lunch there for $12.99 a person. The water tastes nasty, so don't order water and tea. The sodas will mask the taste of the water. The spicy tuna did not have any flavor in it. We also ordered the shrimp hibachi and it tasted so bland. You have to drown them in the sauce. I do not recommend this place.",0
6935966,2,"Disappointing dining experience at a place that is usually consistent and conscientious. 

Pleasantly greeted and promptly seated, the evening was off to a good start. The server was helpful and really took time to answer questions and offer suggestions.

The bottomless salad bowl was tasty and full of good ingredients and the rolls fluffy.

But the main course ordered was less than acceptable.  The Cajun pork chop appeared to be basically grilled without a speck of seasoning to suggest any Cajun flavor.  I say appeared because the pork was cooked to the point it was impossible to cut with a knife or pierce with a fork. Can't imagine attempting to chew it even if it could have been cut into bite sized pieces.

Bad enough to have to send it back but when the server and manager both offer condolences for guests not liking the dish we honestly felt that was wrong.  To say we disliked the fact that the food was inedible just seemed insulting. Hard to not like something you can't even carve up enough to taste.  I guess you could say we did not like the way the kitchen made the pork chop too tough to, well, chop. That would be an accurate statement.

Making a customer feel bad about a kitchen failure is just not good business and does not make sense. And it does not make me want to go back.",0

By now I am talking to the manager and all he says is ""we are understaffed"". Wow, what a great help. He was also shedding very badly, his body was still damp, and he was shaking which he has NEVER done when we have picked him up from the groomers. I can only imagine what happened while we were gone.

But our dinner started by the hostess prancing us around the entire restaurant 2 times in search of a table, we passed numerous empty ones. At last we were seated. The waitress didn't know what kind of beer they had, so she had to go write it down and returned.  We ordered and that is where is got worse, our food arrived, and was all mixed up on plates AND we hadn't had salads yet. So I asked for a plate so we could rearrange our food correctly and asked if we were getting salads.  They brought those AND a saucer...are you kidding me ????? We asked to speak to manager and explained our disappointing experience he did say they would give us a discount. I'm sure at this point the waitress knew it was over....as she asked us if we needed boxes  and we were still eating!!  One steaks which was ordered medium was bloody

Cost for Jiffy Lube to change it.. $62 ... $50 labor apparently for something that takes less than 30 seconds to accomplish (I went back to get a refund, and it was less than 30 seconds labor).

Burger came after wings but onion rings was cold it was sitting back there while burger was cooking I guess

Finally the person who was to paint my nails took care of my friend's toenail painting while the manager or owner came to paint my nails.

When she painted them she had someone waiting for gel nails so she haphazardly and sloppily painted my nails. When I asked her to paint to the edge or cuticle she threw a fit.

401984,2,"This review is based on the dim sum only.  OK, I really wanted to like this place because it's the closest dim sum to me and their egg yolk buns are good. Yes, they don't have the roll-around carts that are more traditional, but I actually don't mind just ordering off a menu as it means I can get exactly what I want faster.  So I gave this place 2 visits to try and convince me, but unfortunately, no.

I judge a dim sum restaurant heavily on the quality of their har gow (shrimp dumplings) and theirs are not good. Although they do visibly have shrimp in them, they taste fishy and stale, as if they also have substantial fish paste filler of some sort. The pork and shrimp dumplings are larger than I expect, but this turns out to be because they're mostly pork, and the shrimp can barely be tasted at all. The eggplant with shrimp was okay though a bit oily. And as mentioned the egg yolk buns (a sweeter dessert option) were good.

The biggest fail was the deep fried calamari rings. Yup, that's what the menu says - deep fried calamari rings. What arrived was a big bowl of deep fried random vegetables, with a few calamari rings perched on top. Seriously, over half the bowl was not calamari. It was mostly just deep fried carrots, peppers, lots of onions... not calamari at all. Sorry, but I've ordered calamari at dim sum restaurants in many, many dim sum restaurants in several different cities and this is the ONLY place that's been so cheap as to fill up the bowl with deep fried vegetable scraps and then have the nerve to charge $10 for it. It wasn't even great calamari, what of it there was - fairly tasteless, needed more salt, could have used garlic or something too, and was a bit too oily. I am so unimpressed by this that I've uploaded a photo showing what the ""calamari"" bowl looked like when I had removed all the calamari.

Sorry, but I'm going to have to find another place for dim sum. Neither the food quality nor the business practices impress me here. Try Beijing, Beijing just up the road instead if you're looking in South Edmonton.",0
5478374,1,"Is Dentistry a Business or a Profession? Most say both. However this place is ran like 100% business. It did not feel much like medical profession there. The dentist there named Prematee Drishma Sarwan acted like she's treating you as a kid, and showed much concern with money, and the money managing person there ensured to make you feel like money was everything.

They will sneakily bill your insurance company till they failed then they will send the bill directly to you, asking you for the payment of service or care (feels more like going to a spa or salon) you did not receive. 

To prevent your bill from going to collectors (considering they will hurt your credit score) you will have to pay right?

My wife and I went to Juanita's tonight, probably our 10th time. We were seated, and we waited a few minutes and the waitress came to us as asked if we were ready to order. The obvious answer was no because we still needed menus. She came back to take our order and we ordered two appetizers and two entrees. My wife's appetizer came out about 15 minutes later but mine never came out, I had to ask for it. Mine came out shortly thereafter. As we were eating our appetizers we tend to watch people coming and going. We finished our appetizers and waited another 40 minutes and watched not one but two tables get their meals even though they were seated as we were eating our appetizers.

I brought my car in for a simple bead leak repair.  In case you were wondering, a bead leak is something that can be repaired in 10 minutes or less.  They kept my tire for an hour and a half before calling me to tell me it was finished.  

When I came the next morning to pick it up, they had one guy working the service counter who was extremely rude.  No ""hello"", no ""good morning"", nothing.  ""What do you need?"" was the greeting I received.  The only plus was that they had the correct tire done and ready to go at the counter.  Then I asked him if he had anyone to throw it back on my car for me.  You would've thought I asked him to solve a Rubik's cube in under 5 minutes.  Again, putting a tire on a car, with the professional tools they have, takes 2 minutes.

The couple behind us left without paying, after arguing that the receipt says weekend taco bar, yet there are no tacos.  I go through the tiny buffet, and as my empty plate meets the heat from the food, I can see all the grease still on it from prior meals.  Had a cold burrito & lost interest halfway, due to my wife finding eggshells in hers & the fly now visiting my right arm.  There was no salsa anywhere in the buffet to even help salvage the food with, because they want to charge you for making it tableside. Altogether, the worst meal I've paid for in Tucson.  I wasn't setting the bar high, it's a buffet for cripes sake, but $29 for this crap was robbery.  Made me that much more grateful for Sundays at Casa Molina's nearby.

The third time was good.

5303094,2,"Tampa, Tampa, Tampa. I'm disappointed in you. People actually think that THIS is as good as it gets?! For shame! Clearly you need to open more restaurants like Yoko's, I Ai, SoHo... because that's just sad.

My coworker treated me to lunch here today & while for the most part I enjoyed my lunch, like Stephanie D. I just wasn't wowed. Or even really satisfied. I have to totally agree -- nothing struck me as *fresh*, & while when I was eating I couldn't put my finger on what about these otherwise decent rolls was off, I realize that yes: they were pretty much warm. NOT good. Also, the rice should be stickier -- it wasn't as dry as I've been unfortunate enough to encounter at some places, but it left me wanting.

& this may sound odd to the American observer who's used to bigger = better, but their rolls were too big. They need to be packed down tighter, so they can be popped into the mouth in one bite. Even a small mouth (like mine). My companion's got a big mouth & even he seemed to be struggling a little bit; I managed -- but barely.

In short, it was a decent enough lunch & I sure won't argue with free, but neither I nor my coworker will be returning here if we can help it.",0

     long story short: the 37 year old short person, bearded, tattooed with eye glasses (stating to be a manager) refused to discount the price after we complained to him post-ride that the vehicle's bell was inoperative which made us slow down & lose precious momentum when we approached people walking on the bike path since we couldn't warn them which caused few close calls. 
    
    Besides the brake was half efficient & the cranks were grinding badly, all he said that they don't have time to check everything on the bikes & he resisted any fair compensation. It was NOT about a $5.00 off, but more about the principle!!!!!!

    Bad management that cares less about the customers safety & well being. This place should be run by ethical responsible people, SO be careful renting from them & check everything on their old beat up bikes so that u don't hurt your loved ones or some one else.

I got a call Thursday saying they did a drive and couldn't replicate the problem so I could pick it up. I told him I had a video I could send and he said he would show the technician and they would drive it again Friday.

6860466,1,"AVOID THIS PLACE!!! Worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life!

I arrived at 9:00am, and asked how long it would take to swap out a tire that had a slow leak. The associate at the desk told me ""about an hour,"" so i sat in the waiting room, and found that it took a full hour before they even took my car back to look at it. 

An hour later they came and told me that there was a pinhole in my sidewall, and that the tired needed replacing. I selected a tire and authorized them to replace both back tires.

An hour later, I was still waiting, so I asked the manager, Jerry Allotey (jerry.allotey@searshc.com 610-892-8295), when I would be done, and he stated that he didn't know, but would check. I asked what was taking so long, and he stated, in a rather indignant fashion, ""Sir, you didn't have an appointment, but we took you anyway, but when our appointments come in, we have to stop working on your vehicle and work on those vehicles.""

I could scarcely believe what I had just heard. I responded that once he committed to taking my vehicle back, they had an obligation, and I had every right to expect, that they would work on it, uninterrupted, until complete. He said they don't work that way, again, in an aggressive and innapropriate fashion. 

At that point, I told him that I had been waiting over three hours and that I wanted my vehicle back, regardless of where they were with the change. He replied, ""You'll get your vehicle when we're done with it."" I couldn't believe my ears. I told him to write up his invoice, because i was going to get my vehicle. He said, you can't go in my shop, and i replied ""watch me.""

When i got to the shop, a mechanic, Darren, was tightening the lugs on one of my wheels, and i asked if he was done. He said yes, and I said great. Then the manager came running out and starting yelling at me to get out of his garage, and I told him that I was leaving as soon as they gave me my keys. The mechanic, realizing that there was a ""situation"" unfolding, then stated, ""Your keys are in your fucking car. Take them and get the fuck out of here."" I turned to the manager and said, ""So I can see all your employees are very big on customer service.""

Then the mechanic started to approach me, and said, ""I will fuck you up if you say one more word."" Needles to say, I said many more words at that point, as did the fat little mechanic, Darren, who literally had to be restrained by his colleagues, as he was trying to attack me, like we were in a bar fight.

The manager jumped in my car, and said he was taking it around front and would meet me at the cash register. I walked to the retail area, as the fat little mechanic kept running his mouth.

As I paid, the manager continued to run his mouth as well, at one point, literally stating that I ""was lucky that no one had no one hit me in my head with something."" I replied, ""Are you F'n serious."" and he replied, ""Yes, because that would have been a big problem for you. I replied, ""I'm pretty sure that would have been an even bigger problem for you.""

We exchanged a few more unpleasantries while I paid the bill and then I left.

Again, this was the worst customer service I had ever experienced, and when I complained and asked for my car back, they told me I couldn't have it. When I attempted to take it, they threatened me with a physical assault.

3535951,1,"I had been craving dim sum for the longest time. I've lived in Philly for nearly 6 months now and have only been once (I think it was at the end of January). So finally, Chris (my husband) and I woke up early enough to head over to Chinatown at a decent hour. 

We waited for about 15 minutes before our number was called. Much to my surprise, we didn't have to share an 8-person table, but had a two-seater all to ourselves. The manager walked us over to a table, where a waiter was changing the tablecloth. He said something to us in incomprehensible English, and Chris and I looked at him blankly. We're pretty good with accents, especially Asian ones, but we had no idea what this guy said. He said something in Chinese, and again we looked at him blankly. Finally, in frustration, he said loudly, ""What kinda tea you want? You drink tea?!"" I said, no thanks, no tea.

He stormed off.

A few minutes later, he came back to our naked table, arranged a tablecloth on it, and rudely threw down plates and chopsticks.

Chris and I looked at each other like, dude, what is this guy's problem? Don't get mad at me because we can't understand your horrible Engrish, buddy!

Dim sum ladies came around, we got a few dishes, and naturally, we wanted to flag someone down for drinks. No one came near us, including our waiter. At one point, Chris tired to flag him down, but he ignored us. Mind you, we had no water at our table either, despite having declined the tea.

Thirty minutes into our meal, I got fed up and said, ""Let's just go. This is ridiculous."" I decided right then and there that I would not leave a tip for this fool. NOT SOMETHING I NORMALLY DO-- I'm not afraid to tip generously when service has been excellent. But this was to the point where it seemed like we didn't have anyone assigned to our table. 

Knowing what we would get ourselves into (see Mindy C's review), Chris gave me cash. I paid up front, took our dollar change, and we proceeded to walk out the door-- opposite of where our table had been. We were walking down the steps toward the entrance, steps that were flanked on either side by patrons waiting to be seated (about 30 people or so). Then I heard, ""Excuse me, excuse me!"" Kept walking. ""Excuse me sir!"" I turned around, knowing Chris was right behind me. I saw the waiter and Chris facing each other.

""You forget to leave tip!"" said the watier.

To which Chris replied, ""You didn't even serve us."" 

Everyone around us quieted down. I gave the waiter a dirty look and said, ""Yeah, you definitely didn't serve us.""

We walked out of the restaurant. Once we were a few paces away, I heard, ""Hello, hello!"" I turned around to see Wonderboy standing outside of the restaurant, trying to wave us back. I waved back and said, ""Hi!"" 

Having read the reviews on Yelp, we knew how the workers of this place were notorious for chasing people down and badgering them for either not leaving tip or not leaving enough tip, which is why we knew not to use a debit or credit card. No way we would have left our information with this place!

First I'll start off by saying I wouldn't have even written this review if the manager would have done the right thing and given us a free night for our next trip, but he DID NOT so here we are. When we first arrived in our room the thermostat said 81 degrees. It was SO hot in there that we couldn't even relax in the room. We turned it down to 70 and left to go visit some friends at their hotel on the beach. When we came back 3 hours later the thermostat was STILL at 81 degrees. We were going to a wedding that evening so we needed to shower and get dressed in the room. We called the front desk and they sent someone over to fix the AC. He could not fix it, so they sent more maintenance people to the room to go into the attic from inside our bathroom. 3 men were in our bathroom with a ladder and the ceiling tile out with paint chips all over the floor. I have provided pictures for you in this review. You would think they would have offered us a different room to shower and get ready in. But NO. My husband couldn't shower, we couldn't change clothes in the bathroom and we were trying to get ready in an 81 degrees bedroom with 3 men in our bathroom. We left to go to the wedding and when we returned there was a note left for us saying they were unable to fix it and they provided us a portable AC unit. WHY WOULD THEY NOT HAVE OFFERED US A DIFFERENT ROOM AT ANY OF THEIR THREE LOCATIONS???? Who just provides a portable AC unit? I know this is very long but here is the BEST PART. I called the manager when we checked out and he said because of our experience and for our trouble he was emailing me a 50% coupon for our next stay FOR THE SECOND NIGHT! (Never got the e-mail by the way). Never in a MILLION years would I pay any amount of money to stay here again. I booked through an outside booking company but it was still WAY overpriced. I literally cannot believe he wouldn't give us a free night to use in the future to try and make up for the nightmare stay we had. If management would have done the right thing, I would never have written this review.

Today, I randomly called David's Bridal to ask a question about bridesmaids dresses and was told, oh your dress is here it came in TWO weeks ago. No one even took the time to call me and tell me the dress I will wear on the most important day of my life was there! Thats not even the worst thing.

Upon talking to the woman who answered the phone, I come to find out that the alterations to the style of the dress I was promised ""aren't normally done in the store"" So basically they sold me a dress with a dream that can't be executed. Again, still not the worst part!! 

While speaking about the alterations I was told could happen, I mentioned to the manager that I was cap sleeves added to the dress, she said I don't understand why you want cap sleeves your dress has sleeves. I said NO it doesn't! Turns out the sales person ordered the WRONG DRESS!!!!!! I have been waiting on this dress since the end of May, wasn't told it came in and now it's the wrong dress!!! This is literally a brides worst nightmare! 

The idiot sales person, Amanda called me asks how I'm doing (stupid question) and tells me she wants to know what dress I ordered to see IF they ordered the wrong dress. I said there is no IF here, it's the wrong dress. I still have yet to receive an apology and was told they would get back to me in two days to let me know what they can do. The manager calls me a few minutes later with ""good news"" that the alterations I want can be done. I told her that is absolutely besides the point because there is NO DRESS to alter!!! Now of course I am worried sick that I am going to have to go buy a different dress or even worse buy something off the rack that 20 other women tried on and rejected. 

Please, for the love of God, save yourself the horrible hassle and stay away from this location. I read the reviews on this site after I ordered my dress and was so thrilled I had a good experience. Turns out the reviews are all correct. Stay far, far away from this location. I wish I had read the reviews before hand. Now I am less than 4 months from my wedding day with NO DRESS!",0

2620913,1,"I wish I would have read more yelp reviews before going to this location. Growing up I loved California Tortilla, I would eat there frequently but after many years without it, I will not be returning. This red lion location is HORRENDOUS, dirty and altogether a horrible experience. We went on a Friday night and ordered a burrito and a bowl, the bowl was disgusting I couldn't even eat half of it, the chicken seemed as though it had been sitting out for hours, as well as the ""mixed veggies"" that were thrown in tasteless and soggy. The only reason they get one star is the queso we ordered on the side was tasty, the chips were stale. Not to mention we both felt sick after, and a day later my stomach still does not feel well. I will most defiantly not be returning to this location, and probably no other locations for a while. Also the men's bathroom was closed as it had a sign ""out of service"" and the women's bathroom had no toilet paper and was a mess.",0

Not going on about the rest of the experience, but they sure play a lot of games, and I wouldn't consider buying from them.",0

A restaurant dedicated to all types of grilled cheeses! I can't wait to try!"" Read Yelp reviews, of course, and still couldn't decide what I wanted to try first visit. I spoke to the gentleman at the cashier who explained the most favored options on their menu as well as his own. Finally, I went with the ""most popular"" grilled cheese: Baja Melt. I couldn't finish it all, size-wise good pricing, but I felt like I was eating a quesadilla! I was hoping to taste amazing cheeses from sandwich, but definitely didn't get that. 

If I ever chose to give it another shot, I guess I'll have to try the original grilled cheese.",0

2844525,2,"I've been to a lot of conference and by far this center has the worst signage for directing people around the center and hotels. One of the presenters was in a wheelchair and found the long carpet covered ramps between the connecting hotels difficult and tiring to travel. The staff had to come in and fix divider walls during presentations that they should have done earlier. They never unlocked the presentation rooms so if you went out during a session you couldn't get back in. The presentation rooms were dirty and had a large pile of crumbs on the floor. There were some benefits...great big exhibit hall and lunch and dinners were decent. Breakfast was ok. The room we had at the Radisson was OK. The door lock occasionally didn't work right. The front desk did accomodate my request for a fridge for the room to keep breastmilk in.  However there was still a charge, but they only charged one night instead of every night for the fridge.  The cleaning staff didn't restock the towels one day so we had one wash cloth between four of us. If it was me I would go west and hold my conference at the Hershey Lodge (Hershey, PA) or Seven Springs Resort (Champion, PA). Food is better, the rooms are nicer, and they have it set up right.",0

Most of the time they are not attentive at all & we have walked out on 3 dining experiences because either we never got service  or our server dropped off drinks and never returned again after waiting 15-20 minutes. I can understand , if they are busy, but only 1/3 times they were busy . And even If they are busy there should be communication from the wait staff about the snail speed service explaining to their table they will be right with them & confirming their table hasn't been forgotten about. Though I hope to see an improvement. Another reason we return is hope we will receive better service . We are super excited and very hopeful all of the restaurants and stores thrive in the Street of St Charles . It is our neighbor & we love it so far !!

They were hanging around gossiping, while me and my friends sat their starving. The flies were sickening. Again, I'm saying this to help you. Please take this as constructive criticism. The owner of any venue should never be sitting around enjoying back rubs while throwing me and my friends dirty looks. The bathroom needs to be bombed with a lot of cleaner and fragrance spray. Also, the music was too loud, especially given the TV noise being loud also. The workers are very kind but I think they need more structure to their training.

4506307,2,"My husband and I came here for a mini-honeymoon trip following our wedding. We found a decently ok room (only one window, but clean at least). We had mentioned ahead of time that we were coming for our honeymoon and, while we weren't necessarily expecting an upgrade, a ""Happy Honeymoon"" from check-in would have been the least they could do. They didn't say anything.

The worst part of the stay was that there was no sense whatsoever of privacy (which you kinda want on your honeymoon) because the walls were SO THIN. We could hear everything in the room next to us, including the fellow guest walking around their room at all hours of the night. We felt pretty uncomfortable and said something to the front desk...first they told us to come back later to see if any rooms were available, then they told us that if we wanted the chance of a different room, we'd have to entirely pack our bags up the next morning, bring them downstairs, and they would see what they could do. We weren't able to move, of course. Not once did any hotel employee apologize or express any emotion whatsoever over the fact that we were essentially sharing our honeymoon with the guests next door. Ugh.

We had to request a second bathrobe...twice... And one day we found a hamburger just lying on the floor of the hallway. One of the elevators was down the entire time we were there. The photos of the hotel looked cool, but that was really the lobby -- the room and hallways were not much by way of design.

TLDR: If you want a super mediocre hotel with thin walls and poor hospitality, this is the place for you.",0

I have eaten at quite a few restaurants in the downtown New Orleans area and the food at this restaurant was very bland and mediocre.  Service and ambiance was very good.  Prices reasonable.  Started with the seafood and okra gumbo.  Very bland.  Not spicy at all.  Not very flavorful.  The shrimp in the gumbo were the size of a sea monkey and overcooked.  I had gumbo at four different restaurants the week I was in New Orleans and this gumbo was by far my least favorite.  Next, the crawfish etouffe.  Bland, bland, bland.  Not spicy at all.  Not very flavorful.  The side dish of corn maque choux was pretty good and the highlight of the meal.  The bread pudding for dessert was good but not great.

They cancelled with only 4 days notice!  It will be virtually impossible to find a new venue in such a short time.  I cannot believe that a business would be this unprofessional.  I had never been there before, but friends of mine have had parties there in the past and raved about it.  My son loves trains, so it sounded perfect and it was very affordable.

She then said ""did you need something?"" I placed my order and the whole time she didn't make eye contact with me or anything.

I waited and the order time was very quick, but she just sat my salad and soda up on the counter and didn't say anything. When I went up and asked another woman working if it was mine she said ""it's waiting on something."" They then put the bread bag on the salad bag and said nothing.

When it arrived we both looked at eachother confused like a mistake had been made. But no, one breaded chicken breast sans noodles is what $10 buys you at Rich and Charlie's.

My husband had the salad and it was OK. It's a salad...that's hard to goof up. 

I had the mac and cheese, which I've had before and a side of their famous cornbread. The mac and cheese tasted like it came out of a box and I didn't even eat half of it.  The cornbread was dry and hard.  I ate two bites and that was enough for me.

There aren't many options on Mt. Lemmon. Because of this experience, we will definitely try one of the other restaurants.  

Our server was nice and tried to interact with us. I appreciate his personality and kindness. With that being said, he didn't notice that I only ate a few bites of my meal or ask if everything was acceptable.

3327066,2,"It'll do for a quick stay. 

Location:
This hotel is about 25 minutes from the airport. Pretty much surrounded by many restaurants and easy to get on the highway. I would say the location of this hotel was the highlight. 

Room:
I was expecting somewhat of a comfortable stay. New photos uploaded by the hotel show newly renovated rooms. And as you enter the lobby is beautifully furnished. Not sure if I was given an old room but it was very basic. 

The beds were made kinda lazily. The pillows are very flat and uncomfortable. It got to the point where I questioned if I should travel with my own pillow from now on. The TV is really old and when I first turned it on the display was glitchy. You do get a mini fridge and a microwave which is nice. 

The bathroom was rather nice. Plenty of towels and toiletries. Though there was a pretty musty smell. 

Food:
There is a kitchen that offers free breakfast but I did not eat there. 

Love:
Mainly it was the location that made it easy to get around and get food delivered. 

Hate: 
The quality of the room. Very basic and in some cases run down. I understand it's not reasonable to expect Hilton-esque quality but standards should be raised a bit. 

Overall:
I'd only recommend this hotel if you're trying to save money and only staying around for just a few days. I don't think it's as horrible as other people have said. But it's definitely not going to be a delightful stay.  

It must be a custom of the area, but every morning I woke up to finding flyers and coupons slid under my door. I have stayed at many hotels and I must say I have never really run into this before. Not that big of a deal, but it can be annoying and I don't really want to be peddled to while I'm staying at a hotel. It's possible someone who's already making a delivery to someone in the hotel is going around leaving behind flyers but management should put a stop to this.",0
759454,1,"I've eaten at Golden Corrals before & can usually find something vegetarian to eat aside from salad. However, every single thing I tried was dry and flavourless. My husband, who does eat meat, said the same thing. It's not like we came in at 3 pm. We came in right during the lunch rush. Food should've been hot and fresh, but none of it was. I ended up eating a bit of salad, though it took a few tries with dressings. The blue cheese tasted like mayonnaise, so I ended up going with the least-offensive Italian dressing. This place was horrible; even the desserts were severely lackluster. The apathetic cashier annoyed me as well. I have many friends with a lot of visible piercings and tattoos, but I always though that in a restaurant it was the usual standard policy that you can't have nail polish(chipped hot pink nails, especially) or facial piercings, because most people think it looks unprofessional. I have no problems with piercings; I've some myself, but the attitude was quite unprofessional. There's no need to seem so bored, inconvenienced, and world-weary as you're taking my money.  If you don't like your job, quit. The food is probably the reason they make you pay in advance before getting any food. They don't want customers refusing to pay for the swill. The only thing that tasted OK were the mashed potatoes, which are probably not even made from scratch, given the quality presented elsewhere.

1612200,2,"Trying to start into this review is particularly difficult for me as I am very split. I wavered between a rating of 2,3, or 4 but ultimately feel that as of now, a rating higher than 2 is unfair to all the other restaurants i've reviewed. Here's why:

My first experience of Cafe Poca Cosa was 10/19/2012. It was my birthday which I usually don't celebrate since my husband has usually been deployed and I find it depressing to celebrate alone so i just pretend it doesn't happen. Thankfully, this year my husband made it home in time for my birthday and did a great job making it special including planning a relaxing night out at the much acclaimed Cafe Poca Cosa.
After struggling to find parking, we just parked in the parking garage that CPC is connected to. Pretty convenient! We walked right at our reservation time 8pm on the dot! After a few minutes the hostess finally made it back and greeted us. We gave her our name and reso time and she said our table would be ready in just a few and if we would mind waiting at the bar. Sure, it's my birthday, I can start with a drink! So we sat at the bar. The margarita I ordered (el chinaco) was fabulous. Possibly one of the best margaritas I've had! 
Every few minutes I would glance at the hostess and a few times she made eye contact and smiled. I assumed that meant she was still waiting for our table. My husband was now starting to get irritable complaining ""what is the point of a reservation?"" Several people have now come in and have been seated. Around 8:40pm, 40 minutes AFTER our reservation, i approach the hostess asking if our table is ready yet. She looks at me and says oh what was your name again? REALLY?! You asked us to sit at the bar and it is your JOB to keep track of people in order to seat them. She advised us to close our bar tab which had been long done and took us to an empty table surrounded by a few other empty tables on the other side of the restaurant. 
So in all, we waited 45minutes, now a quarter till 9pm, just to be seated. She didn't apologize for making us wait so long. Incredible! 
Luckily our waitress was very nice and before she could even tell us the menu we told her what we wanted. She was decently attentive, not gone too long but not overly attentive.
Food was some of the best i've had in Tucson. Fresh, tender, tasty, it was perfect. My husband and I both ordered the sampler typed platters that feature different items off the daily changing menu. Both of our plates were different so we were able to enjoy 6 different items! Plates are served with hot tortillas, beans, and super soft delicious rice. 
I am still frustrated with the horrendous lack of customer service from the hostess but because the food was so great and put together, I will come back for another go. Thanks Cafe Poca Cosa for ending my birthday on a annoyed and frustrated note!",0

Food: Maybe we ordered the wrong things. The eggs and benedicts and sandwiches we saw on other people's plates looked really tasty, but we are more of a pancake/french toast crowd. I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast with cream cheese filling and it was the epitome of mediocre---a few pieces of cinnamon bread, probably bought in the grocery store, cooked in some eggs, with literally just slices from a block of cream cheese haphazardly laid between them. My family got pancakes, and they were OK (huge, by the way, one is probably enough per person). The scrapple was good, and on the plus side, they give you Sriracha, which the other breakfast places in Downingtown don't do. 

Service: When we were there, it was unseasonably hot, so there were some condensation issues from the pipes in the ceiling. The first table we were sat at was being dripped on, so we said something and were seated elsewhere. But right after we were moved, they sat another family in the same place. That's kind of bad... Our food was slow to come out, though the servers were nice enough, and gave helpful advice.

349836,2,"I've had oil changes and a few other small maintenance service done here several times (perhaps 5 or 6 visits) over the past three years and the experiences I've had really vary from good to horrible.

The one consistent positive is I've always been able to schedule an appointment online or over the phone without any issue. Also, some of the staff I've interacted with have actually been very pleasant, attentive and helpful.

However, the actual service itself and many other face-to-face interactions with other staff I've had have not been consistent or pleasant at all. I've had great, quick service once or twice but the other times I've left feeling frustrated and/or scammed. They usually say they will call or text when they finish and I've only once received a call. 

The final straw for me though was after I recently consulted with a different reliable mechanic a few days after my last visit to Pep Boys for an oil change when my engine pistons still felt gunked up. My new mechanic pointed out that Pep Boys didn't even actually change my oil despite charging me for the full service!!

196421,1,"One night I came home to my apartment flooded with 4-7 inches of water and I live in the first floor. I called maintenance immediately. I was informed, they were next door, drilling my neighbors sink. The snake accidentally came all the way thru to my sink and busted the pipe under my sink. My whole island was gushin out water for hours thank God I came home early that day.

They offered to call a vacuum guy to come suck all the water out of my apt but my rug, carpet, games and belonging were soaked! My couches leg were stained, when the pipe busted under my sink sewage water was all over my whole entire apartment floor. Every time someone flushed that night it came down my sink and I saw my neighbors shit pretty much. They had to go tell people upstairs to stop using water until they figured that out. 

I was told that Saturday night Monday the manager will follow up with me. I waited all day Monday and called the manager myself and they were completely clueless . I would hope the maintenance staff would help relay the news but no one here can do there job. I was told by a manager on the phone ( I hope the called are recorded) that they would look into it. They offered no cleaning for the sewage water on my floor. No other place to stay it stank like human feces and they said they'll help fix the sink. Again I never called them to fix my sink originally THEIR plumber broke my sink while fixing my NEIGHBORs why the fuck did I have to suffer for this? Weeks went by they just told me to file a claim thru my renters and every time I called back I had to reexplain everything again. I never heard back, the Maintenance MGR cleaned my carpets ( not rug ) that came with the apartment and that's all was offered I never even got a single apology good God what kind of fuckin shit heads run this place wat kind of service is that.

4956918,2,"In short - pasta is fine, service subpar. 

----

This review is based on experience at the take-away fresh pasta counter portion of the place, not the eat-at bar/counter and is based primarily on the (poor) service received. 

When I got to the counter the cashier was helping another customer so I checked out the options while I waited. By the time she finished another couple had joined me at the counter also waiting to be helped. Rather than helping either of us, the cashier walked back toward the kitchen area. At first I assumed she was going to help people seated at the counter but after a few slow sips from her water bottle and some flirting with guys cooking it was obvious she wasn't planning to help anyone. 

I eventually got the attention of one of the cooks who came over, without apology for delay, to help us. I was eventually on my way with pasta in tow but when I got home I discovered that the product in my bag (several tagliatelle nests) weren't even the flavors I had ordered. Not sure how it is possible to confuse the bight magenta beet pasta with plain unflavored but I guess that is asking too much for this pasta shop.",0
3217563,1,"Five stars for the public beach, the sea and the waves. Our weekend started with calling the hotel to see if we could use the beach since we were going to be there early. The lady at the other end was brusque, to put it rather mildly... ""you can't use our parking or our beach before check in. Sorry, have a good day"".  Well, I understand the parking- it's only valet and $25 a night. The hotel's not even on the beach- you have to cross the road to get there... to a public beach.  Then we pulled up and had an angry dude refuse to get out of our way as we pulled up. I asked him if he was staying at the hotel too, thinking he was another exasperated soul... but he retorted ""I work here""... The restaurant had a bunch of empty tables, but the wait time was half an hour to 40 minutes... so we ate at the nearby Hyatt, which seemed to be running like a well oiled machine! The elevators broke down, and I got some well added exercise climbing the stairs. The gates to the road between the hotel and the beach locked up and so more exercise was in order!
So, teaching point- stay at the Hilton or the Hyatt... it's the same sand, surf and seagulls... and nicer humans :)",0

We ordered within 5 minutes having read reviews, and decided on food stuffs. 
Sunday was a happy bar tender, and a delight to be around, we felt taken care of. Thank You Sunday. 
We ordered Crab Claws, Chargrilled oysters and gumbo. 
Crab Claws- juicy crab claws in a buttery, savory sauce with a few small pieces of bread. We asked for more- they had none (strange.) 
Chargrilled Oysters- so aromatic! Cheesy, garlicky and buttery. Pricey but worth it. 
Gumbo- disgusting. Not even edible. Rice was undercooked and it had no flavor. 
We tried this place because of Yelp, thanks everyone. 
2 stars only because of Sunday, the crab claws and the oysters.",0

The waitress was about to seat us and then the manager decided that he wanted to seat a larger party instead so he told us that we couldn't be seated and told us to leave. I speak Chinese and there was no communication error here. No mention of how long to wait. The waitress said oh how about that table in the corner which was clearly not being used and he just waived his hand at us and gave us a really rude look. I was speechless.

There were so many people standing around doing nothing.  Nobody even bothered to tear our ticket. Then we watched people in the concession area on their phone and sitting on the counters.  No one was working the bar for the 10:30 pm show.  It was dead.  

The bathroom was filthy.  It was covered in piss and water.  The floors were so wet they were slippery. Who decided to only have one small bathroom at the front of the lobby?

Then there was the theater experience.  There was stuff on my seat.  We had to clean it before we could sit down.  Then, I raised my foot rest only to discover a smashed box of nachos and cheese....  

The movie was out of focus.  The projection wasn't centered and that affected the picture quality.

This place had a lot of money put into it, but the management and staff will sink it.  We aren't going back, and we are telling you why.  It's depressing watching people piss money away, but theater customers have options and more theaters are opening all the time.

Good luck...",0

6014348,2,"I had a falafel shaped hole in my heart.  It was a Sunday evening and I had a hunger that only deep-fried balls of chick peas could fill.  (Ok, it might also have been fillable by a sandwich from Twenty Tap, but they were closed).

There was a white piece of paper taped to the door to Sam's.  ""Enter"" it said in black magic marker scrawl.  I walked in and up to the cash register, and ordered a falafel to go.  

""What kind of sauce do you want?"" the girl behind the counter asked me gruffly.
""What are my options?"" She listed a few.
""What's your favorite?"" I asked.
""I don't eat falafel,"" she said.  Okay... well.

I ordered a whole falafel sandwich with tahini sauce and tzadiki (counter girl indicated that the sauces balanced the dryness of the falafel).

First, the good: It's a generous portion.  A whole sandwich (about $8) consists of two half pitas.  There were lots of cucumbers inside, which I liked.  Also, the bread was soft.  Overall, it was edible.

Of course, there is room for improvement.  The tzadiki tasted of sour cream (shouldn't tzadiki be made of yogurt?).  The falafel was very, very dry.  The decor kind of matches the food and service; everything seems haphazard.

Sam!  You have a killer location.  People love falafel.  This could be a five star spot.",0

We received a notification that our order was being prepared but no notification that it was finished, so that I had call to verify that it was done. I told the person on the phone that we hadn't received any verification but it was already an hour when the wait said 20-40 minutes. She made a point to argue that she pushed the button to say the order was done, but honestly she could have just noted that whatever system they're using isn't talking to the Yelp system. If you order from yelp just take note that may happen to you.
Anyway. The food is mediocre for the price. We got two Bento boxes and some appetizers which was plenty for a family of four, but the quality wasn't fantastic. I'd have been happy if we spent half as much. The top foods were the Age Tofu and the Shumai shrimp dumplings--very good, great texture, fresh. In the Bento, the tempura was fine. Otherwise, the teriyaki chicken and fish were dry and the california rolls weren't flavorful.

I wouldn't recommend trying to sell your clothes here-they pay minimally for anything you bring in, regardless of brand, and the staff are pretty snooty and rude. I took a bag of brand new clothes with tags to the store this week (all bought from Zulily so I couldn't return to them) and the girl told me they all looked like they had been worn for over 2 years and that they were stained.

I want to like this place. Really, I do. Because I live a block and a half away, and it would be so convenient to have a reliable cafe option this close. 

But this isn't it. I mean, the food and drinks are decent enough. But not worth the exorbitant prices you pay. And oftentimes, the bored hipster staff can't be bothered to get your order right in the first place. On several occasions they have ""forgotten"" to swap out the soy milk for almond milk in smoothies I've ordered. Not a big issue for me, but a HUGE one for my gf, who has a soy allergy and thus had more than one upset stomach thanks to their carelessness. 

I finally reached my tipping point this past weekend. It wasn't only paying through the nose for an order that, again, wasn't quite accurate. It was running to their house ATM mid-checkout, after realizing I was a few dollars short, and coming back and seeing a sign that says they now take credit cards--a fact the bored cashier didn't mention at any point in the transaction, even when I was frantically scrambling at the ATM. Any normal cashier should say, ""hey, we take cards now if you want to pay that way.""

I had the filet of sole. It  was acceptable but not taste bursting. The combination of so-so food and a non-enticing desert menu prompted us to end the meal without desert.

We stood in line and ordered like everyone else.  It was 7:20 pm and the restaurant was not even half full, so we didn't expect a long wait to order or to get our food.  We had waited half an hour for our food when we noticed that the couple in line ahead of us had already been served and finished their meal.  Three more orders came out of the kitchen and we still didn't have any food.  After a 45 minute wait, I asked the front desk guy about our order and he said ""I don't work in the kitchen. The guys back there are working hard"". While both of those statements are true, it still did not get us our food.  My husband then spoke to the front guy and he was even ruder to him than he had been to me.  We started asking the different service guys bringing out food if they had an order for Allen.  One server was very honest and said that the tickets get all mixed up in the kitchen and out of order, but that he would check on it.  We finally got our food and ate a very late dinner, at least for us.

2762615,1,"I've never liked this place, but our recent experience here has been so frustrating I had to write a review. The place is a factory, there's no personal care, and you have to pull teeth to get answers or help with anything. We've been here countless times and no one remembers anything about us or knows my kid's name. Two years ago I asked for some testing to see if my son has the same heart condition I have, the doctor rolled his eyes at me and acted like I was a stupid, anxious mom. My son was later tested at Vanderbilt and found to have a congenital heart defect that will need constant monitoring for the rest of his life. 

After that experience I stopped coming regularly and mostly got my son treated at the urgent care. But when he needed a Covid test after an exposure at school last week, I brought him in. They'll charge you $40 for what should be a free Covid test to get your kid back to school, you'll have to wait over an hour in a germy office to get it, then they won't give you the results of your rapid response test for over 48 hours, making the test pointless. Kids can return to school 7 days after an exposure with a negative Covid test, or 10 days if they don't get a test. I communicated this multiple times to the people at this office and they took my money clearly knowing I wouldn't get a result in time. Other clinics are doing rapid tests in the car so you don't have to come in, the tests are free, and results are fast. Old Harding is profiting off of this pandemic and it is gross.

I'll never come back to this place.",0

3540841,2,"I was so excited to try out Vetri's Roman trattoria-style eatery having been to Rome twice in the past year and eating the best pastas of my life. And Vetri is a rock star in Philly, and Amis got good reviews and I basically thought I could trust all that...Wrong.

The pasta sauces weren't even close to being Roman let alone tasty Italian-American! The cacio e pepe was more alfredo and the pecorino lacked the tangy bite and saltiness that I love in that dish. It was just so creamy and mild with not nearly enough black pepper, not authentic at all. The amatriciana was even worse. There was a scarce amount of giant cubes of pancetta that were basically just fat. The tomato sauce was pretty much just tomato - no spice, no flavor, just warm tomato... I had the best amatriciana in Rome for half the price, and an arguably equally good bowl at our standby Melograno.

We got the secondi special that evening, pork loin wrapped in pork belly and they had just got the pig in the day before. The pork belly was very fatty (to be expected), but the loin was tough. When you pay for a special at a Marc Vetri restaurant, badly cooked pork is unacceptable.

The salad was so salty that they might have made a mistake (either way, a bad move), the grilled focaccia that came with some of the apps was soaked in stale oil that oozed and coated my mouth when I bit into it (gross!), but the meatballs were good (not spectacular though).

The napkins look like dish towels, which is kinda neat, but they shed like crazy all over your clothes. Whatever you do, don't wear black.

What we liked: the service was fine, but it was very in-and-out and our dinner was over in less than an hour. Vetri's famous fresh pasta was solid. They were a bit overdone for my taste,  but I like my pasta very al dente so I'll give them the pasta. 

Overall, we were so disappointed by the meal that we didn't even stay for dessert.
I would not recommend this restaurant at all. I feel like we ordered a balanced spread of dishes, and we weren't impressed by any of them.",0
4598866,1,"BEWARE- DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE APPLYING FOR A CARD WITH BARCLAY!

My experience with the Barclay Itunes Rewards Credit Card was so poor that it prompted me to write my first review. It amazes me that a credit card company would deliver such disappointing customer service given our current financial climate.

I have been a customer for many years and lodged my first dispute weeks ago after my husband and I returned from an out of the country vacation. The vendor failed to deliver the services we paid for. I would have thought this an easy fix as we had documentation supporting our claim.

Barclay did NOTHING to support me as a loyal customer. I am not exaggerating, from my initial call which caused me concern because of the ineptitude of the staff to the lack of follow up communication after I submitted a formal letter to the final and only call I received stating that the claim was denied- the experience was agonizing. 

This was such a negative experience that I wrote the corporate offices, doubt that I will receive a response, and Yelped! The message of ""you don't matter"" definitely resonated with me. I am clearly good enough to service when they are slapping me with a monthly interest charge.

And a very ineffective one. She was afraid to push the cuticles back and afraid to cut my nails, so that by the time she was done with all that, it didn't seem like much had been done.

She then went to go prepare the self heating seaweed mask for my hands. Before she put it on, she made the comment that it was very hot, hotter than usual. In fact, she said the mask was so hot it seemed like it was melting the plastic tray that it was in. And despite all this, she put this mask on my hand, and the instant it touched me, I pulled back in pain. Yes-- it was that hot. Even after we washed it off with some water (which only made it hurt worse because the self heating properties of the mask is activated by water), my hand still hurt for the entire manicure.

After all this, I still stayed and got my nails painted. It turned out pretty sad. I realize this is a school, but I would have done a better job painting my nails myself. It was clumpy and a lot of it ended on the sides of my nails and on my cuticles. Since it wasn't cleaned up right away, while the polish was wet, when she tried to clean it (after the polish had dried), it marred the already set polish that made it on the nail. Not a pretty sight. Definitely did not look like I had a ""manicure"" done.

The pedicure was a little better, but still very tentative. Luckily the polish went on fine. 

The instructor came in and I told her about my experience. I don't know how the grading system at Aveda works, but the instructor gave the student all perfect score, even after I told her what happened. 

When I went to check out (3 hours later), I mentioned my dissatisfaction to the woman who checked me out. She offered me a free manicure at the same salon, which I turned down. 

My overall opinion is that if you want a professional job, go to a professional. If you go to the Aveda Institute, you might get lucky, but then again, you might not.",0
5799856,1,"My friend and I had an absolutely horrendous experience at this establishment. I ordered the burger quesadilla and when it was brought to me and I began to pick up one half. I noticed a hair sticking out of the burger. Thinking it was maybe my own, I began to attempt to remove it; unseccuseful. I called the waiter over and he removed my plate and sent the manager over. The manager then told me he ""dropped a new burger himself"" and I'd have my new plate in a few minutes. I received it, ate half of it and enjoyed it. I took the other half home and that a evening, went to heat up to eat for dinner and noticed a hair,  AGAIN!! I called the restaurant and let them know what happened. The closing manager offered coupons, but I live 30+miles away and don't plan on returning because of this, and I said my friend had treated me to lunch and I'd see if she wanted a refund. After speaking with her, she agreed that that would be nice and I called the same manager back and he, again, offers coupons, which, again, would do no one any good, as she lives 100 miles further away than I do. I asked if he could simply refund her credit card and I was informed that that was not something he could do. End of discussion. Please, if you choose to dine at this establishment, I beg you to inspect your food. Or better yet, choose a different restaurant.",0

This place had great potential. The sites were nice, a little small but OK, the beach nearby was a plus,  showers and bathrooms were reasonable, benches and fire rings were good amenities and the soft ground was just right for building a tent. 

So why the 2 star review you might ask? Well as another reviewer had said, this place falls victim to its own popularity: our fellow camping neighbors were TOOOOOOO LOUD AFTER QUIET TIME!!!!!!!

It's not the fact that they were loud, is the fact that there was NOTHING the park had in place to handle it other than a self enforced 10pm quiet time rule. Needless to say the quiet time rule was not well ""self enforced"" by our neighbors. They were not even our ""next door"" neighbors, they were about 30 yards away or so but I was still able to hear every single word spoken, spontaneously blurred out or sung.

I noticed their loudness early, but since it wasn't quiet time yet I let them be for the time being. As quiet time approached, I noticed they were making no preparations for quiet time, so as 10pm came and went, I decided to give them more time to settle down, hoping they would soon settle for the night. BTW at that point I hadn't slept in 30 hrs, so this explains why I needed the quiet time to sleep. I assumed there would be some type of night patrol enforcing rules like in other campgrounds, but as 11 pm arrived and the noise level did not drop, I was pretty sure there was no night patrol.

So now at this point (11:30 pm) I'm horribly annoyed by their noise and lack of respect for their neighbors, so I first decided to just ""tone them out"", I even used ear plugs, but then they busted out a guitar and the noise level jumped! So that was that, got to do something about it. I decided to walk in the cold, misty night to the ranger station at the entrance of the campground. Lo and behold it was empty. So I then decided to call the park rangers office (somebody, anybody that could help) with no avail, office closed. 

No choice left, I had to take matters into my own hands. So I went to strongly tell them to please end the noise. A soft apology from them followed and they toned down their noise from a 10 to a 7, not quite what I needed since they should've been at 0, but I had to take what I could.

Sorry to bore you all  with my story of trouble and grief, but I really wished it didn't have to come down to that. It pretty much ruined my camping adventure, I was only there for 1 night but glad I didn't stay longer cuz those people were still going to be there. I live in the big city (LA) and I really wanted to get away from all the noise. Sure the campground was full but everyone else was quiet like they were supposed to be. Really wished they had a night patrol to handle what I didn't have to handle. I don't plan to come here again until I hear of night patrols being used.",0

The history! The food! The reputation! 

The Good: I tried the buffet. The fried chicken, the spicy sausage, Lima beans w/ shrimp and stuffed peppers were delicious!!!!!

Unfortunately, the majority of the food was lackluster. 
The catfish was under seasoned. The shrimp on the po boy and the shrimp in the Clemenceau were tasteless. 2 servers recommended the Shrimp Clemenceau as ""their favorite dish."" The shrimp was over cooked and fishy. 

The peach cobbler has a cake-like topping and not pie crust and was tasteless.

The service was friendly, although they ran out of tea. There was a man--the manager, I assume--hovering over all the workers, making them nervous, and not improving the service. He happily offered to order some kid to brew more, but it wasn't done before I was ready to leave. I'm surprised they didn't realize they were low when nearly everyone was ordering it. 

The food was the problem, though. It was bad. My enchilada was ice cold, but served (quickly) on a very hot plate. They subscribe to the school of excess cheese standing in for flavor. I also ordered a veggie taco, which was good but not great. 

I'm always eager to try a new place close by, but Taqueria del Sol may not earn a second visit. If I get a hankering for that veggie taco in a couple of months, I may go see if they've ironed out their kinks.",0

5828652,2,"This was the most disappointing part of the trip, was eating here! 

Being from the Bay Area, we found a place to watch the Warriors vs Cavs NBA finals game. Not only did we think we found a great place, we found a place that had it on a big screen outside in there own patio area. 

We got there an hour before the game and got what we thought was a great table. However, once the game started and more people started showing up, they started putting the tables closer to the TV and it started to block our view! Not only that, the people coming in demanding they put tables out there for them to watch the game, weren't even ordering food or drinks. So they were standing up, blocking our view and not even buying a thing. NOT COOL! 

We also had no service outside for this event. Everything we wanted, we had to walk up to a window and order which I thought was completely nuts! We are there for the game and to spend money and we have to get up and do it ourselves. I know this place lost money because I wasn't getting up to get stuff that I wanted because I didn't want to miss the game. Send a waiter or waitress around and I would have bought more drinks. It wasn't just me, it was everyone. 

The food, nothing but just normal fried bar food. Was hoping for something better!

5429962,1,"Thought easier to take my review from Google since its so long.
Not a good place to go if training for Veterans Service Dog. Karen the owner is rude, talks down to you, and charges crazy money when she makes it sound like she cares. If you questioned her methods she is condescending.
 You can only talk to her through text, and is always busy. She had tried to  give me a blind dog, another dog who was destructive,  me being his 3rd house,  the dog bust out of the cage, destroyed, growls,  and known behavior  of killing chickens from another vet who had Stryker before me, the last guy was to busy getting high, and not caring for the dog, Karen also tried to give me a 7 year old dog to train as my SD, her and argued in text how insane this would be. The dog would graduate at 9 years old. I am finally glad I woke up of wasting my time for over a year, and money to have the courage to leave and found a great business who also helped me get a great Veteran Service Dog in Training, trains with me, and treats me like a human being, my baby Chloe is what a SD is to be, and I am trained with weekly. The company doesn't brag like Karen feels the need to. 

My other beef with Karen,  she will only train for 3 task, where my dog is allowed to learn ad much as is needed for my disabilities,  I should not have to pick and choose, but trained on what I need to function. She wasn't  honest, and always badmouthing other Veterans to me, not counting her rudeness to me, countless times my husband corrected her.

I do not get why the disabled  from day with the dog having all its shots, are not out learning Public Access work in a pet friendly place. My dog already has aced it. Karen will not do this, until around 16 months. Karen makes you board and train, which means she charges you more and more money to not have you NOT present until the end. They charge you to have them train without you there. 

Ive asked Karen to take down a letter as me, a Veteran I wrote, she had no permission to use, when this dog washed, Karen did not want to wash her, but I had her evaluate, to be told she should not work, she was fearful,  Karen blamed me and made stories where I took her to public places, Only took her to dog friendly places where I was told to practice. Its sad she is still using this letter when she promised it would be removed, this is false advertisement to Veterans using words I asked to remove because finding out this was all a sham. I have tons more, in text from her, thank God I saved all,  but not worth my time to keep texting. I can only share the truth of my husband and my experience with Karen.
 
My view Karen to me is about money, and status, not helping vet's but lining her pockets with her crazy expensive program. It's a shame because she does have good trainers.",0

I have used this service before without any problems, however, on 6/15 I had a grocery pick up between 5 and 6 PM, we were already out and needed a few extra things so we were in the store at 5:10 when I saw a message saying my pickup was delayed, no time on when it would be ready. We left the store at 6 and still no update on the order, so we pulled around to the pick up area and decided to wait there. Someone came out about 6:10 and said my order was being processed and it would be no longer than 20 minutes, 45 minutes later someone else came out and said they were waiting for the manager to come and approve something, she was very nice and apologized and asked if their was anything she could get us, I told her that the ice cream I had just bought was probably melted by then so she took the ice cream to get replacements for me, which I knew she probably would not find because the ice cream was completely wiped out and I couldn't even get the kind I wanted (imagine that, on a 95 degree day and no ice cream)!! She came back and said she couldn't find the kind I had and she was so sorry, she was still waiting on the manager to also let her know how she could compensate me for having to wait so long. So about 7:00 she came back said the manager never did show up and gave me my order and that was that! No compensation for having waited at the pick up area for one hour and for having my order late by 2 hours, apparently the manager was too busy to care! I will definitely think twice before I order grocery pick up again, this was a disaster!  The poor girl looked so upset when she had to bring my groceries and she could not compensate me for having waited so long because the manager couldn't be bothered!!  
Also the store looked like a tornado hit, it was destroyed, bare shelves as usual, I just don't understand why having stocked shelves at all times is so difficult when other stores in the area have no problem! When it is 90+ degrees outside it would be common sense to make sure ice cream is stocked! This store is looking a lot better but has a long way to go with keeping shelves stocked.",0

Not only were they served on a broken plastic tray, but ice was put ON TOP of the oysters, which made them lose their taste and we had to dig through ice to get them.  Not only that, but Every. Single. Oyster. had shells inside it (which is a sign that they were not properly shucked, and surprising for an ""oyster house"").  Additionally, one of they oysters tasted like it was way past it's due date, and one shell came without an oyster at all. To top it all off, when the food arrived, the plate of Jambalaya came with a nice curly black hair and with powdered sugar on the side... not what we expected.  When this was brought to the manager's attention, no apologies were given. In fact,
he had an attitude and was rude to US when we told him about the problems with the food.  We didn't eat our meals and left to an amazing restaurant a block down the street.  This is by far the WORST food and customer service I have ever experienced. I wished we looked up the reviews on yelp before we came....",0
2688562,1,"Thank you for the reply, Kristi.

To clarify:

1) I was NEVER offered another pair/color of jeans when I was informed about the back order. I have documented all of the discussion that passed between myself and your administration and this never occurred.

2) I did mention that the doortag from Canada Post never got to my door. Yes the jeans sat at the post office - but I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THEM and was NEVER sent tracking information even though you had it in your possession. Therefore the fact that it sat at the post office was not necessarily my fault.

3) Once again, this is another fabrication. Yes, you did offer to deliver the jeans to my house but you never once offered to refund a portion of my payment and then do so. I declined delivery to my door because this had happened several months after my order and I no longer needed the jeans.

4) Yes, you offered me a 40% off coupon. I apologize for not mentioning this. For all of those reading this commentary - I was offered a 40% off coupon for a future purchase at Key-Lime.

5) At least own up to the fact that this was a huge error on your part instead of fabricating lies to paint me in a negative light. Thank you for demonstrating the poor customer service that I mentioned in my previous review. I am so disappointed, mortified and frustrated that you would even go out of your way to ""apologize to me"" while passive aggressively claiming that I didn't tell the whole story. Abhorrent.",0
1906627,1,"In retrospect, our involvement with Hamstra was a mistake.  We started the search for a new AC and heating system mid-summer of 2017 thinking that the five ton twenty year old system which had just been refilled with about fifty percent of it's refrigerant needed to be replaced.  Mind you, in the triple digit temperatures, it was cooling fine but we were concerned about it's reliability.  I contacted one HVAC outfit after another finding out the range of prices and suggested equipment and finally settled on Hamstra after early on having called them for a bid.  Their suggestion was to wait until November when the factory rebates and TEP rebates to return.  This set the stage for my failure to remain as critical and demanding as I should have.

The first thing we have to remember when dealing with HVAC issues is that there is a standard protocol for determining the capacity a home needs.  That is called a Manual J calculation.  Unfortunately I found out quickly that Tucson HVAC companies don't often use this process and rarely do it correctly.  The first company I contracted sent out a salesperson who I told that I wanted a Manual J calculation done.  They responded with a bid and after I demanded to see the Manual J, gave me one dated three days after their bid was completed.  I then decided to hire an engineering firm to put one together for me.  Mechanical engineering firms don't usually do residential work, but I got one to came out and prepared a Manual J for us.  Emphasis on ""came out"" for an on-site visit.  If the HVAC company doesn't measure glazing, inquire about skylights, orientation and shading of your home, additional insulation and the like, you won't get an accurate Manual J.

I gave Hamstra a copy of the Manual J I had prepared.  It called for a 2.55 ton unit.  Not realizing that they didn't do their homework, I took their criticism of the KC Manual J as being accurate.  Hamstra told me that the calculation had six inch walls instead of the existing four inch walls on the house and recommended a five ton AC unit.  I should have immediately gone back to the engineer, but instead took Hamstra's talk about being thoroughly professional and ensuring that I got what I wanted.  Their bid and work was a third more expensive then the highest previous bid for virtually identical equipment and more than double the least expensive bid.  To be fair, Hamstra included a sealing of the ducts and some additional air circulation cutouts, and I simply wasn't convinced of the professionalism of the other companies.

It took me a while, but buyers' remorse started to set in when after a month of waiting, Hamstra had to be called to remind them their work wasn't completed, who then installed 3"" vents rather than the 4"" vents promised with some jibe about ""nominal sizing"" and we started to realize that what we were told about the unit wasn't really what we were experiencing.   Improvement but not as quoted.  I also went back to engineering firm and had them redo the Manual J with four inch walls - turns out the difference was slight - requiring a 2.61 ton unit.  One might ask ""does it really matter if you get an oversized AC?""  The answer is that an oversized unit will cool quickly, stop and wait, resulting in uneven cooling and is actually less efficient than a properly sized one.

MY BAD, I simply gave them the benefit of the doubt after being through the wringer with the other companies lack of competence and professionalism.  Purchasing an item this costly is stressful and I allowed myself to hope for the best rather being more critical.",0

READ IF YOU ARE WITH A PREGNANT WOMAN

So my pregnant wife and I have gone here twice, the first time we just assumed they were a busy place and let go of the fact they stuck her in a convict room that had no working television and we couldnt exit without approval. We got her medications and left after about 3 hours.(whatever. Its a hospital, you expect somewhat of a wait.)

HOWEVER the second visit was one of the most unprofessional experiences for a hospital ive ever had. Not only did the woman responsible for my wifes ultrasound treat her like crap for simply asking if she could tell the gender, she then proceeded to wait til they were exiting the room to tell her not to get her hopes up for a boy name. She literally stole a special moment from her by treating a possible gender reveal as some common news without showing her anything. My wife was very depressed about this since this is our first child. 

DOESNT END THERE! After 6 and a half hours of waiting for a urine sample result, we finally were getting to leave. 

Or so we thought. My father-in-law went to get our keys from security.

The security guard Pablo D. proceeded to tell them the car was parked all the way around the back of the hospital, and that usually he would assist us, but he was going to be the only one there for a while.(Lie.) After 15 minutes of my pregnant wife walking around with us looking for the car, i had to run all the way back to the front entrance. 

Guess who suddenly wasnt alone. As i entered security, out of breath from running after Pablos lie. I start to tell Pablo and a heavyweight black man that seemed to only go by Britham, that we still cant find this car and i have a pregnant woman with me. Pablo states loudly ""Sir. Youre gonna need to calm down."" I wasnt upset then, but after that i absolutely was and explained to him that yelling calm down doesnt calm anyone. He then left the room announcing ""you can deal with this one."" and walked out. Immediately i asked his name to report it, and he continued to walk away meanwhile Britham screams in what im assuming is suppose to be his intemidating voice ""STOP. STOP NOW. GET BACK HERE."" i continued to follow Pablo because Britham has zero authority over me, and asked the front desk clerk what Pablos name was, but he proceeded to pretend he had no idea who i was asking about, clearing playing games with me. Luckly there was a real cop there so these rent-a-cops couldnt pretend they had any authority over me, like Britham was trying to scream with. I explained my situation to the cop, he assisted to communicate with me professionally (like what security needs to train for) and helped me find the car. I will absolutely be reporting the security and nurse responsible for ruining the gender clue to my wife. 

Dont recommend this place if you care about your wife and children.",0

Not fit for consumption. I had to recook all the patties to get them to medium. But even after drenching mine in ketchup it was barely edible. The other 4 were in the trash after a couple of bites.

3675065,2,"My wife and I were disappointed with our Burger Republic experience after reading the great Yelp reviews. NOTE: we ordered take-out... maybe that was our mistake?  My burger (Oscar burger) was good, but I ordered fries as my side and only got 10 single fries.  WTH?  Is there a potato shortage?  The fries were okay - they're the thicker kind, whereas I prefer the thin crispy ones - but they were all right.  

My wife got the Harvest Chicken salad, and it was more like chicken with a few pieces of lettuce on the side.  Seriously, it looked more like a half chicken breast on a skimpy bed of lettuce than a salad.  It was supposed to come with apples, but the apple slices were razor thin and there were only 3 of them... so maybe 1/16 of an apple?  She didn't like the dressing either; it was supposed to be a vinaigrette, but it was a very creamy greenish dressing (looked like a Green Goddess but not as good).  She's not usually very picky (the Southwest Chicken Salad at McDonald's is a frequent choice when we're traveling) so this was pretty bad.  

So the food was a definite meh, other than my burger, which - while good - probably wasn't worth the $13 I paid for it.  $25 for a decent burger, a few fries and a poor excuse for a salad is a disappointing take-out experience.  It might have been better if we'd eaten there but based on this, we'll be in no hurry to go back.",0

-I  asked multiple times for a concentrator to be used on the hair dryer, she told my multiple times it's not needed and that I'll see once she's done.  Finally she tells me she doesn't have a concentrator because she doesn't use them.  

-I don't know any legit hair stylist who uses a round brush to comb out dry hair.  Are you trying to damage my hair?! No I'm not talking while hair is being dried, I'm talking about when hair has been dried, then running a round brush down it from roots to ends ike Rapunzel combing her hair.  

-Icing on the cake was finally me asking her for the hair dryer and brush to fix it.  She wanted to know what exactly I didn't like about it.  Nicest way I could put it was ""all of it"".  So I finally trying to fix it myself to look halfway decent.  She then rushed to the register to print out my bill.

Ended up tying it back into a bun since it was just too pathetic to walk out with.  $45 for really just a wash, since I did the ""styling"" myself.  

I will still continue going to Ulta, because my regular stylist in NJ works there and I know my experience at this location  doesnt represent the standard of services provided at Ulta.",0
6821821,2,This is the type of place you go to eat only because nothing else is open! And it tastes like a last resort too. The shrimp on the shrimp nachos has way too much breading and not it's enough cheese on the nachos. Also the chips they use for the nachos are too thick. The bean burger taste like they are fresh out of the freezer and completely falls apart when I tried to eat it. And it's not the cleanest in there...but hey it's a last resort like I said before. Oh but the fries are pretty good and the customer service is decent.,0

Requested Iced Tea, no sugar no lemon and very little ice and this asshat refuses to make it. Today, as I sat thru the drivethru astonished, and much like the Soup Nazi, he tells me Iced Tea comes full of ice. Then he refuses to make mine and tells me to go somewhere else. Okay then.

1703019,1,My girlfriend & I both ordered the 8oz fillet with mashed potatoes. Thirty minutes later the waitress tells us they ran out of mashed potatoes (which is the only side to choose when ordering the steak). Once we finally get our steaks they are both cooked medium well. We had ordered them to be medium rare. We were offered new steaks and our meals for free but decided to leave at that point. The waitress was amazing though. We left her $20 because we felt bad for her.,0
594101,1,"Giving the AT&T store one star is too much.
 I purchased an upgrade on-line and chose the ""pick up at store"" option. After calling them to see if my order was ready, they said ""Yes, we're processing your order now"" So, after waiting for almost hour Steve said they could not honor the deal I made on-line. I would have to purchase the phone from them at a much higher price. 
This is a perfect example of Bait and Switch. Their whole attitude is TS, that's what you get for using AT&T. 
I've been an AT&T customer for many years and am sorry to say their customer service has declined to the point that I can no longer use them.

462457,2,"My partner and I were craving the delicious egg sandwiches on the toasted wheat bread that we remember Crown Candy to offer.  So off we went and waited in line this afternoon for about 15 minutes to get one of the few booths they still have in the restaurant.

Crown Candy is run as inefficient as you can possibly run a restaurant.  You wait in line for one of the few booths.  You have what appears to be a busser to cleaning the tables as they are vacant.  You have two servers.  Time gaps between your line wait, your wait to have the table cleaned and the busser arrives, and then time between the busser leaves you and the server arrives . . . just not good!

Back to the food . . . we each ordered the egg salad sandwich for $5.49.  Comes with pickle and some potatoe chips.  The egg salad was just dry - bread was toated, but the egg salad was just DRY and lacking any taste at all.

So next time I'm craving a delicious egg salad sandwich . . . I will fly to Los Angeles and go to The Apple Pan!   The Apple Pan has the best egg salad sandwiches in all of America!",0
3148185,2,"I discovered today that they do not pre-screen dogs for fleas before letting them into daycare.  I never thought much of it at the time, but for a few years we sent our labs to a big box chain that has a day camp and they did a thorough screening of the dogs before allowing them into camp.  We recently started sending our puppy to Barkefellers to try them out. Today the groomer called me after trimming our pup's nails to say my dog had ""a flea"" on him and they were kenneling him until I picked him up.  She said my dog had no evidence of fleas - flea dirt, other fleas, eggs...just A flea.  He does have a skin allergy that we are trying to figure out, but no rashes, red marks, bites, but he scratches.  Turns out, she explained, the dog that was in before him had fleas.  Their policy is to take a dog out of camp if they see evidence of fleas - which is great and I fully support, but don't you think you should at least do a comb through to be sure you aren't letting the fleas in your day camp in the first place?  I'm thinking the big box is doing something right with their pre-screen process.",0

There was a good crowd of people at the time.  As an appetizer, we had the Mint Moon Crepe. My girlfriend had the combination Pho and I had the crispy Hen with rice. After ordering, our food came out pretty quick. The thing lacking was the service. In total, we saw our waiter twice. We drank all of our water and it was never refilled. It took forever for us to get our check and it also took a while for our waiter to come and get my credit card. For a restaurant this size, there should be more than 2 waiters working especially during lunch time. We also noticed there was a fly on our lettuce that came with our crepe, but we didn't bother to complain about it. Food was great, but service is definitely slacking.",0
3766947,1,"Customer service was terrible. I bought my Mini Australian Shepherd puppy back in the middle of April. He was only there for 24 hours, but I was able to take him home that night. A week later, he started excessively coughing, and I knew he had kennel cough. I took him to the vet for antibiotics, and a few days later, my other dog got sick. I contacted their customer service on June 6th to file a claim with all the paperwork, and it is now August 4th and they have not mailed the check after I have contacted them several times. Also, included in that claim, were two distemper parvo shots I had to pay for even though Animal Kingdom's ""veterinarian"" gave him his shots already. They vaccinated him too early that he needed his shots again.

I will never recommend them to anyone, they take terrible care of their dogs, and their customer service is terrible. Go buy from a reputable breeder, you will save time and money in the long run.",0

I will never buy another piece of furniture from Mealys nor will any of my friends or family after the nightmare I've told them I've been through.

Their sign says they are open for lunch on Fridays and Saturdays from 11:30 - 2:30 but a friend and I tried to stop three different days after Target runs and they were closed. When we finally did make it the service was really unfriendly. No smile and welcome and kinda made us feel like we were a pain. Crazy Cafe on 301 is FAR better and worth the little drive.",0
4197891,1,"Okay, I want to start by saying I created a yelp account for the sole purpose of reviewing this establishment. I would also like to say, I am going to try to be as gentle as possible. I have been through the rigors of culinary school and worked in many restaurants through our my career, so I understand the passion that goes into a local establishment such as this. I hope that anything I say can be viewed as constructive and not mean or hateful.

Anyways, I want to start with the establishments physical features. From the outside, the restaurant looks clean, however the inside was not. The center piece on the table was filthy and looked as though it had been left in a grease trap for days. Please, for your establishments sake, clean the piece that's your patrons will be viewing for an entire dining experience.

 Second, the service. I really can't insult the service. Everyone that I came into contact with were friendly and welcoming. The only suggestion I would throw out there is, a little bit more empathy for what I am about to write.

As a  former chef, I understand food, and it is one of the most important factors in any meal, if not the most important. Food in general should be treated with much higher standards than what I witnessed tonight. Frankly, what I witnessed was purely insulting. First, the butter for the bread was rancid. I almost vomited after smelling it. The salad was wet and quite disgusting. After these two things, I was almost turned off but still confident in what mattered (the main course). Well, it was also disappointing. The Mac and cheese had a bitter taste, almost rotten to the tongue. My wife's chicken strips were the worst, not because of their preparation or quality, but because of there presentation. Two of these chicken strips had beard hairs (assumed) cooked into the batter.

All I want to say is, please, don't let this happen again. It saddens me to see a local establishment with heart go down this path.",0

I want to blow my brains out.  I am number 1043.  They are up to 1029.  It has already been a half hour.  I don't get this waste of everyone's time.  
Later that day....Finally finished!   I wanted to ring a gong bell as I walked out from enduring the horrible boring wait.  Overall, it took exactly 2 hours at 10:30 am on a Wednesday morning.  A few people ahead of me apparently did not wait therefore my number was called a little faster.  
One really good thing is, I have been wanting to switch my Political party (Democrat vs Republican) and I never knew how to do that and just let it go.  As I renewed my drivers license and got my real ID changing political party can be done at this time.  That was awesome.  
If you are applying for a real ID...make sure you have your social security card in hand!!  You cannot proceed without it.  
The staff I came in contact with were friendly enough.  Once your number is called it takes about 10 minutes. 
So glad to complete this chore.  My 1 star rating is based solely on the 2 hour wait.  They give you a deli style ticket number so you can leave for a bit and come back which I did for the first half hour.

She is not typically picky, but it was bad.  My steak dish was not very good, it tasted like steak-ums.  The main problem was the owner refused to refund the money for the uneaten tuna and was rude and insulting in the process.

I couldn't help overhearing my roommate also having issues with his care and treatment.  Depending upon your nurse, there were numerous times when my treatments were not provided in a timely manner, some times up to 12  hours later than prescribed which endangered my health and recovery, totally unacceptable.

I also experienced times when I pushed the call button and they took over 30 minutes to respond, lucky for me I was not having a medical emergency at that, but they did respond within a few minutes when I did have a medical emergency, once again, this was dependent on different staff members that were working that day.  This was also one of the factors that caused me to seek another facility.

They do have internet access and Brighthouse cable service.  The place is clean and not a human warehouse as some of these places can be, but my experience,  as well as my roommate's has led me to move to another facility that I am much more pleased with!

5297832,2,"The only reason I gave Patou two stars instead of one, is because I had a good experience the first two times I ate there. My boyfriend and I went for dinner three times in the last three years, typically during restaurant week. The first two times the food and service were good and we had a very enjoyable time, which is why we went back. I particularly liked the outdoor seating and the extensive wine list. 

Last year we went during restaurant week for our anniversary, as it had become kind of a fun tradition, and it was hugely disappointing.  It definitely was much more crowded than during previous visits, but they stuck us all the way in the back in this little room that contained about four tables and an enormous big screen TV with football on! Considering the fashionable image the restaurant wants to maintain, it seemed out of place, and was less than romantic for us. If we wanted to watch football, we could have had our anniversary dinner at sports bar. Moreover, my boyfriend's steak was underdone to the point of being cold and raw. The waitress was so inattentive/ busy that she ended up bringing our dessert course out before we could tell her the meat needed  to actually be cooked so that we could eat the entree. By then enough time had elapsed that it was basically too late to bother, and she didn't deal with the screw up well, or offer a discount or anything.

4482728,1,"I am really sad about my experience with Maid Right. It's so disrespectful to come into someone's home who has trusted you as a complete stranger, and be so negligent of their things. Totally unacceptable.

This company has excellent Google reviews, and it was MY BAD for not checking Yelp as well. The reviews on here are much more in line with what I experienced. They were very nice over the phone and prompt with their availability to get my house cleaned. 

But I think they sent a herd of angry cattle in to do the work. 

Several, and I mean several of my things were damaged. Nearly all of my wall decor was hanging lop-sided, one of my mirrors were knocked off completely, and there are two 4"" gashes down my brand new dresser. Among other things that would require more describing than you care about. I was also upset that I had jewelry sitting out that was knocked off and apparently vacuumed up because I'm missing one of a set of earrings now. Anyway, the cleaning was pretty good, but dang were they rough. 

So I called the owner to discuss my concerns and he was all but apologetic...I'd describe him as ""baffled."" He was baffled. He made me feel like I was being kind of dramatic about the whole thing. He claimed that his employees weren't rough and he had no idea how my dresser would've gotten scratched and we went 9 rounds over how that could've happened as he described the entire cleaning process to me. Then what really got under my skin was when he claimed he'd ""stopped by"" during the cleaning to check on how things were going, and nothing was as I'd just described it to him. So, I'm not sure what he was implying but anyway, I digress.

So I was on the phone with this man for over 20 minutes listening to him tell me how confused he was and defending his employees of theft that I never accused anyone of-- I just told him I'd lost an earring, probably to the vacuum. After 20 minutes, he casually suggested that he could refund me 50% to which I said, ""Yes that would be nice,"" and then right back to the disbelief in what I was saying. I offered to send him photos, he didn't really seem to care. 

Anyway, despite the fact that the cleaning was thorough, I give this company 1 star because I would never, ever use a company again that has a reputation of damaging my things. Things I worked hard for, things I love, things I'm proud of, things that were given to me. And a 50% refund doesn't come close to fixing it.",0
1002698,2,"I purchased 2 pedicures in a special on DealChicken for Spa West and went with a friend.  Being new to the Reno area, I was looking forward to checking out a local spa.  

First the good - the pedicure rooms are small, 2-person only, which is very nice.  The pedicures were exceptional!  The pedicure techs were wonderful! And the chocolate martinis, which came with the special, were yummy!  

Now the so-so - the pedicure rooms have benches, and no massage chairs.  I was surprised how comfortable I was on the benches with pillows, but I did miss the comfy chairs.

Now the bad - the receptionist may be new, but if so, she needs better training.  We 20 minutes early for a little sauna time, as we read about on yelp.  When we arrived, the receptionist took us immediately to the pedicure room, then, upon realizing that someone else was still using the room, she left us in the hallway while she tried to figure out what to do with us.  She ended up taking us back to the front lobby area. When I asked about using the sauna, she said that she could not take us into that area because the spa was too busy and she seemed to think it odd that we were asking.

About 5 minutes later, she came and took us to the dressing room area and showed us the sauna... a very small 1 person sauna that was turned off.  She said it would take 10 minutes to warm up.  When I mentioned that we only had 15 minutes until the pedicure, she said that was fine because the sauna had time to warm up so we could use it. She did not offer us any robes for using the sauna, or a locker.  Since we were so close to pedicure time, and the sauna was SO small, we chose not to try to use it.  

We were left in the waiting area in the dressing room which is as I would expect at a small spa. 2 chairs, soft music, tea, water, snacks, etc.  

25 minutes after our scheduled appointment time, 1 of  our nail techs came to get us.  He was very apologetic and very nice, but I wonder why noone came in before that to keep us informed re: the delay.  It should be noted that our appointment had already been moved out by 15 minutes earlier that morning via phone when the spa called us.  We had no problem with the pre-arranged delay, but the extra 25 minute delay from the scheduled appointment time was frustrating.

Again, the pedicures were awesome!!!  And the nail techs were wonderful!

But, the reception staff left alot to be desired.  With all of the spa choices in Reno, I don`t think I will be returning.",0

6294956,2,"I went in for the $6.99 lunch buffet, when I arrived there was only one other customer . I said that I was interested in the buffett. The man said okey and pointed to the buffett and walked away. I filled my plate and seated myself . After a few miniutes someone offered me some water. After a few more minutes someone came by to ask if I wanted some nan. I like nan so I said yes please.When I came back from getting my second plate someone came and asked if I wanted more water. 

They had a good varity of chicken dishes , including tandoor chicken. There was rice cooked two ways , and some fried mixed vegetable balls. I think that I got a little bit of everything. Everything that I got tasted good . However I wish that it had been hotter. 

The only things that I had that were hot were that nan that came out of the kitchen and the dessert of some kind that was fried . 

The staff all seemed rather unhappy. They all looked very serious. 

Turn up the heat on the steam table, pay more attention to the people who are eating there. Ask them if they want anything other than water to drink! 

I will give them another chance after some time goes by . Maybe by then they will have new menus of their own !",0
6214129,1,"If anyone provides this business with more than 1 star, I question if it's a result of never having been to any other pain clinic. I have found the nurse practitioner  particularly
to be concerningly unprofessional. Last time I was there, a client was upset and demanding to know why they were not provided all necessary detailed info upfront-- this has been a consistent issue for me as well. While front office staff is considerate enough  while dealing with staff, I do not feel the same goes for the nurse practitioner. If you can settle for mediocre care/service and this is the only place your insurance will cover, honestly I'm sure they can meet needs. If you're looking for knowledge professional courtesy as a patient with high quality care...I honestly advise look elsewhere.",0
5835549,1,"Very disappointed :( We stayed in a standard suite on the fourth floor. The building is poorly designed and the walkway to the rooms are on the parimeter directly in front of the windows. So you could not enjoy any views without passers-by pearing into your room.  Those rooms share an entrance cubby with 4 other units & you could hear the comings & goings of the other units throughout the night. Doors slaming, people talking. The walls are thin & we had a loud group across from us. The only thing to muffle the noise was the air conditioning. The decor was old & outdated. The vent in the bathroom didn't work. There was only one set of towels, and only 1 chair in our very tiny room with no table. For any privacy at all we had to keep the drapes closed and could not enjoy any views. I felt like a caged animal on display at a zoo. There is only one tiny elevator and it is unvented without exhaust.",0
5454508,1,"This is the worst motel I've ever been to.
 At 10:30 pm, I pulled into the parking lot and it was completely full. So I stopped by the front desk to check in. I grabbed my phone and my wallet and went inside. The front desk person was a young guy. I asked him where I'm supposed to park and he told me I could park in the handicap spot. I asked if he was sure because I didn't want to wake up in the morning to my car being towed away. He said that they monitor the parking for the motel and it would be fine. So after parking, my cousin and I walked up to my room and had my dinner. But I then realized I accidentally left my phone either in my car or the lobby. When I tried calling it,it went straight to voicemail,despite being fully charged less than an hour ago. I tried using the Find my IPhone app,but since it was off,it wasn't picking up a signal. So my cousin and I went down to check in my car and OUT OF NO WHERE a older man came running up to us screaming and cursing at us saying we better move the car or he was going to call the cops because we were parked in a handicap spot. I tried to explain to him calmly that I don't mind moving my car,but that we were authorized to park there by the front desk. But he continued to threaten me and scream. So at that point I moved my car and asked the front desk where I could park my car. He told me there was free parking across the street,and I was more then welcome to park in his spot(pointing to his red car just outside the lobby) when he was off work at 2 am. So I said ok,I will do that. I also asked if he picked up my phone off the counter when I checked in. And he said he didn't see any phone..i said I set it down right by the phone..but he said he didn't see it and he could check the security cameras and give me a call..well 1 hour later I didn't receive a call,so I decided to try the Find My IPhone app again,and it showed its location to be EXACTLY where the front desk guys car was parked.(remember he had pointed to his car earlier when he said I could take his spot?mmhmm)  so I called the cops,but they were extremely busy. So my cousin and I decided to go and ask him WHY the app is showing my phone to be in the exact location of his car. And why had he had not looked at the security footage. He just stared at me and didn't say anything for about 30 seconds and then said he he couldn't look at the security footage that night,but he had an idea on who might have taken my phone. So I told him it might be a good idea to call them otherwise I was going to have the police come down here and investigate for themselves. He said he would call and give me a call..well that never happened! So I called and he said that he was off work now,but I could call and talk to the manager in the morning.  So I called and talk to whomever was working the next morning and she told me that there was nothing they could do. They wouldn't review the security footage. And even after I told her about my suspicions with the front desk person,she told me it wasn't any of their employees and that I probably just dropped my phone or something. I asked about having a cop come and review the footage and she laughed and said that ""the cops won't come here for a stolen phone. They have only come and reviewed security footage one time before and that was for an Actual burglary"" ..at that point I just hung up because I was so furious. 

I'm willing to bet all of these employees steal from their customers on a regular basis and they all cover each others asses. So if you have valuables,do NOT STAY HERE. The most unprofessional business I've ever delt with.",0

6068632,1,"Like Lucas, we additionally had an unresolved issue with this company. We purchased a groupon on February 20th, 2014 for the show on March 7th, 2014 at 7:00 at the Old Spaghetti Factory. However, quickly after doing so, my husband informed me had purchased tickets for a concert for me that same evening. Our friends purchased the tickets from us and we contacted the company on February 26th, 2014 to change the reservation names free of charge as outlined in their disclaimer. While doing so, the representative confirmed all the information and answered all my questions regarding the menu, attire, etc. As my husband and I sat down for our concert I received multiple text messages from our friends that there was no Murder Mystery Show taking place that evening. Them, along with other couples dressed in theme to participate, were turned away by the restaurant. I quickly called and spoke with the manager of OSF and was informed that the MMC regularly held shows there and their system was that the MMC would provide the restaurant with a list of dates they would like to host shows and the OSF would approve said dates. However, this particular evening was never approved as the restaurant had been closed for two and a half weeks for renovations and that evening was their grand re-opening. They stated the next available date they signed off with the MMC was Sunday March 9th, 2014. Our friends, who were celebrating their anniversary, left and made the one hour drive back to their home as they did not reside in Nashville. Like Lucas, I left messages with no return call. It wasn't until I got a hold of someone via Facebook that I spoke with a rep with the MMC. They informed I would need to obtain a refund through Groupon and made no effort to make it up to us or our friends when I pointed out that the mistake lied with them. We received a bare minimal apology when I mentioned it would behoove them to provide our friends (not us!!) with complimentary tickets that read, ""I do apologize detective. It is first come, first available and you can always give us a call to confirm the available dates and times.
Our number is 1(888) 643-2583."" I explained we did confirmed the dates when we changed the reservation names. I have yet to receive an additional response. I have since taken my complaint to Groupon to obtain a refund and refuse to recommend this company to any one in the future.",0

We got the meatball pizza for $16.00. It was about 12 inches, super thin and looked very sparse. There were blobs of ricota cheese on it in like three places, some basil and a sliced up meatball. The taste was ok, but honestly for $16.00, Dominos is way better and more filling.

Almost everyone at the station ordered from this place because they were THAT GOOD.  Wellll... times have changed.  I guess they've changed owners, because this place hasn't been good in YEARS.  I felt I needed to update because I did not want to be the reason people ate here and hated it.

I used to love the general tso's, chicken with vegetables, shrimp fried rice, and egg foo young.  None of these are good anymore.  They use plastic containers which make the chicken chewy and hard by the time you get it home.  The metal containers they used to use were much better for keeping the food hot and fresh. Nevertheless , I kept going here because I still hadn't found a place I like better... until now.

1318910,1,"I feel very, very conflicted writing this review. 
In the past, my cat has been boarded here and has received the upmost care. I truly appreciated the staff here during the times that they worked with me on previous occasions. However, I had a recent situation in which my cat was ill. I was incredibly desperate and took him to Belle Meade. The first day, he was dismissed and possibly diagnosed as having a viral illness of some sort. That was fine. Paid my bill (it was about $150 for a consult and an x-ray too...no issues here).
This is where things get a little ""hairy"". Turns out it was not a viral infection and my cat got worse. I took him back to Belle Meade and they fit him into the schedule. A few hours later, I get a call that I would have to take him to specialty vet as they could not help him there. That's fine. What was NOT fine was the bill after this visit. I was not told about anything that was going to be happening to my cat BEFOREHAND (about prices, tests, labs). While I was expecting to pay about $200-$300, I was shocked to learn that it was OVER $500 as he had had another x-ray (which I would have NEVER authorized as he had just had one done the previous day) and blood work done. I love my animal, don't get me wrong (I took him to the specialty/ER vet afterwards) but for a bill that's more than DOUBLE the first bill is truly just shocking. I quite honestly feel used and swindled. 
Like I said, I had great experiences in the past. But this truly opened my eyes and I will be looking at other vets in the area after this occasion. To improve for the future, it is my hope that Belle Meade will communicate with people BEFORE treatment is done and give you options as well as a price breakdown before moving forward with things. Other vets I have gone to in the past have communicated with me before things were done and I am confused as to why this was not the case here.",0

5471303,1,"I was SO excited to try this place, as I've been jonesing for a bbq joint near the U of A since Red's left. I was really disappointed by my meal today. In hindsight I should have known there might be a problem because I've never smelled bbq in the air when I was nearby.

I chose the half rack of beef ribs with a side of jambalaya rice, total came to $20.65 and got it as takeout. The meal came with a few waffle cut fries and a small coleslaw. The coleslaw and fries were the highlight. I thought jambalaya would mean there was some sort of spice or flavoring or maybe even pieces of sausage. Instead it was just bland red rice on a bed of greens. It was lacking all flavor; it wasn't flavored or salted at all.  

Near the soda station they have 2 sauces in squeeze bottles - spicy bbq and char sui. I tried both and took a few to-go containers of the spicy bbq. The sauce was great and I was hopeful! Unfortunately, the ribs are cooked with the slightly sweet char sui sauce and taste like Korean bbq ribs. They weren't tender and the taste was not what I expected. I ate what meat I could get off the bones and tossed the rest. The description of their ribs says ""mouth watering beef back ribs, spice rubbed, and slowly braised"". No mention of the Korean flavoring. 

I wish I could write a better review, as I live one block away and would have been here all the time if it was legit bbq. My search for good bbq continues. Next stop, Smokey Mo's on 1st & Glenn.

I stand corrected. - the owner responded to my review and advised the spice was Cantonese, not Korean. In either case, I would have liked to know that. He also mentions 'expediting' my order, which was not requested. Since the meats are reportedly braised (doesn't that mean slowly stewed?), I'm not sure what needed to be expedited.",0

I rushed over to the pet store after work to get some medical dog food that my dog needs so she will stop peeing blood and as I got there 5 min before closing they told me I need a certain card in order to buy it. Why would I be buying medical dog food if she didn't need it or I wasn't told to by the vet that she goes to inside that pet store ? I was never told I need to bring it in  to buy it, they told me if I could get a picture they would sell it to me. So I called my roommate and he was able to dig it up and get me a picture but because it was 5 minutes after closing they told me they could not sell it to me. I run a  small business and it can.  Being that it was medical and being that they work with pets you would think they would show some empathy. Guess not and she did it all with a smile on her face.

So I got my hair cut here and it was pretty bad from the start. I walk up to the sign in sheet and they send me to a chair right away, but the barber turned me away because he wasn't ready or something. So I was sent back to the waiting area only to be called back a few minutes later when he's ""ready."" Honestly, he was just on his phone. So he calls me back and asks me what kind of haircut I wanted. While doing this, he's texting on his phone telling other barbers ""I don't wanna be here today."" That is the last thing anyone wants to hear when receiving a haircut. For it being my first time at this shop I felt the exact opposite of comfortable with this barber cutting my hair. So once he finally starts to shave the side of my head he puts the clippers down and starts texting on his phone...then he answers a phone call, then texts some more. Works a little bit on the side of my head, then picks up the phone again. It thought it was very annoying and unprofessional he's more invested in his phone than he is on my haircut that I'm paying for. 

Midway through getting my haircut he asks me if I'm paying cash or card. I said card and he says ""I'm going through a divorce and my wife takes my money so I would like you to pay cash."" I didn't have any on me so that would require me to go to the bank. Once the haircut was done I told him I was going to give him a cash tip, and pay for the haircut on the card. He told me I couldn't pay with my card and that he didn't want to ask his other coworkers to run my card. He stated they would get mad if he asked them. Huh? So, me being cool about it I go to chase bank and get some cash out to pay for my haircut and he's waiting outside the shop in the corner. I try to go inside the shop to pay for the cut but he makes me go to the side of the shop and pay him cash like it was a drug deal. 


The fact he changed his story so I could give him cash was just perplexing and flat out sketch. 

I absolutely hate hate hate leaving bad reviews for businesses, but this was the most sketchy, bizarre, and unprofessional haircut I have ever received. I wish I could come back because it's a convenient location in my neighborhood, but I for sure am not coming back.",0

The very young what I am guessing were managers were in the way of the staff, to an almost comical degree. They seemed to have no idea how to move around a restaurant. Our waitress was completely in her own world, looking around, playing with her hair even at the table. We ordered, and apparently something went wrong with the (open) kitchen. There was a pretty obvious argument going on between kitchen staff, and the floor staff. It was so awkward for us, that when the nice young man brought us our food, we actually vocally commiserated with him. He was very polite and sweet, but noticeably upset. We felt sorry for him. Other than that, the food was so overpriced for just boring bland meals. The dirty plates sat on our table the duration of our meal, and the check was dropped too early. This young kid who I think was a manager asked how everything was on our way out and we said fine, because, well it was way too late. Don't go here unless drinking at the bar. Awkward staff situation to be perfectly honest.",0
3537702,1,"True story...over the summer i went in here with my husband to get a blizzard. I ordered a mint chocolate chip blizzard w chocolate ice cream. The guy working says to me rudely ' and what if i DONT HAVE CHOCOLATE' i was so taken aback i just said 'ummmm ok then i guess ill have vanilla' then he goes on this tirade about how ALL people want chocolate ice cream after 6pm. i just wanted my blizzard. So he's making it and asks me if i want fudge. I tell him no and he continues making it. He hands it to me and takes my husband's order. Once he's done making his, the guy working starts asking my husband if he plays halo.  Then he goes on and on about how he cant believe my husband doesn't play video games. Then he asks him if he's seen some movie and then is appalled bc my husband said no. This wouldve continued for god knows how long had it not been for more innocent customers waiting. (Wonder if they got yelled at for ordering chocolate ice cream post 6pm) Oh and they dont have hard ice cream. Wtf kind of dairy queen is this? And while i was waiting and eating my blizzard, i discovered it had hot fudge. At least i got chocolate ice cream.",0

2651034,1,"""John"" at this location is an absolute tool. The store policy is that guns must be in a case prior to entering the store. I brought in three rifles to shoot at the range but my case would only carry two. I brought in the third rifle (an AR-15), pointing at the ground, without a magazine, and holding it by the rail. I am refused entry because the third rifle is not in a case. So the 2nd Amendment allows me to walk around with it in my hands in the parking lot but the store is more restrictive? Are we in Illinois, California, or New York? I then hold it by its rail to offer John's inspection and he says I'm ""sweeping it around."" What a tool. Had you not had such a liberal, yellow-belly policy I wouldn't have to offer you my gun for inspection. Let's have some common sense policies. Who would've though a gun store/shooting range would have such a liberal perspective.",0
1617564,2,"Meh. 

We used to LOVE Wild Wing Cafe when we lived in Charleston, SC so we decided to stop at this location in Franklin on our way from Destin, FL back to our current home in Iowa. It was just alright. The service sucked. It took over 10 minutes to even have a server acknowledge us and take our drink order. Our appetizer order was wrong but it wasn't worth hunting down our server to have her make it right. Our kids' burger buns were really stale and they barely touched them, I imagine because of this. I get that pretty much nobody cares about kids' opinions of their food but this was pretty gross. Our wings were fine - heavy on the salt though and not as spicy as we remembered. It took a while to get our check which was frustrating since we had two little ones with us. If I could've flagged down any server, I would have. Unfortunately, this experience kind of ruined our nostalgic feelings we had towards Wild Wing Cafe. Oh well!",0
5869972,1,"She was a perfectly nice doctor who, like so many, became enraptured with putting people on Prozac back in the 90s because it was touted as the cure-all for everything from depression to dysmenohrrea.  I was one of those people and I never should have been on it without checking my thyroid first.  Seriously, why would any doctor hand someone some pills without doing some due diligence first?  I lost my faith in modern medicine with this.  Other than that, I suppose she was OK.  

I can't recall anything else I saw her for but that.  She probably wouldn't even remember me.  But I remember being put on a medication that didn't even help me at all.  I was the one who dealt with the side effects and I was the one who dealt with horrible female troubles for which no one bothered to look any further than handing me some pills.  Maybe that's just the downside of being a primary care doc on an HMO.  They are stuck with being forced to treat conditions where if a patient gives up and stops complaining, they feel they are done.  Modern medicine stinks, doesn't it?   I think that perhaps given unlimited resources, she would have done a better job of sending me to some specialists who could have helped me more.  But I'm left seriously wondering why I could never get a doctor to test my blood serum TSH levels before putting me on other medications that didn't even help.  What gives?  

There is absolutely NO blood test or any other kind of test to check your serotonin levels.  Sounds like witch doctoring in my most humble opinion.  All I know is that I feel that the trouble started here when I was barely an adult and didn't know any better than to obediently take whatever a doctor gave me without questioning the side effects or differential diagnosis.",0
6693110,2,"Went to lunch with my husband. We were seated in the patio area.Our server didn't even give us her name. She really didn't even seem like she wanted us in her section. When we were seated she didn't ask us if we wanted something to drink.We ordered an appetizer,pretzel and fondue. It was ok. The cheese wasn't hot when it got to the table,or even after our server lit the tea light candle under it. We ordered fish and chips and the French dip sandwich. The fish does come with a mayo coleslaw but no lemon on the side. The food wasn't that bad it was the service. She just dropped food on the table and would run away. At one point I was going to ask her where the bathroom was,she made eye contact with me and purposely avoided me. The females that work here have a superiority complex.

At $12 for the lox special, we expected something big, beautiful and impressive--especially since the lox is cured in house. It was small and really not tasty... something we could have gotten at a deli for under $5 and probably would've tasted better. If you're going to cure your own lox and charge a ridiculous amount for it, do it well or don't do it at all.

Nope we can not do substitutes. Ok fine then just charge me individually. My husband got the chicken fried steak and my daughter ordered biscuits and gravy. My pancake tasted of nothing but pancake mix and was so pasty that you could barley chew it, hash browns were a SINGLE hash brown stuck together with potato paste and oil, and eggs were so rubbery you couldn't chew it enough to swallow.

6978221,1,"We stopped in this evening to pick up a few things, spent almost $200.  We went to get some lottery tickets at the machine but it does not give change. Only one checkout open  (other than the self-checkout) because the store was pretty empty. Asked if she could change a $100. She said I would have to go to Customer Service.  

I waited at customer service for several minutes while the woman chatted with the woman at the self -checkout.  She looked over at me a few times but kept on talking.  Finally she came over and I asked if she could change a $100.  She says ""You're on camera."" I said okay. She said they can see everything we do here. I said okay.  She said They can see everything you do, and went on for a bit.  i just said so do you wnat me to buy something. She said yes.  

So I went back to the cashier and used a $100 bill to buy a $0.79 pack of gum.  Got the lotto tickets. 

I don't understand what being on camera had to do with her changing money, other than trying to make me feel like a criminal, as if i was trying to do something wrong.  It didn't matter if i was on camera or not. Just needed an even exchange.  She made it seem as if I was trying to rob the place.  

After  getting the tickets, i stayed with the cart while the person i was with went to the bathroom.  the Blond haired woman kept looking over at me and said something to the cashier at the self checkout. and they both kept looking at me.  There was no one else in there.  More whispers, then the one girl goes out to get the security guard.  He goes and stands at the exit behind me.   By then my friend came back from the bathroom, so we pushed the shopping cart out to the car.

So beware.  If you spend $200 in groceries, and ask for change for lotto tickets, and wait a few minutes while someone uses the bathroom, you are considered a threat to the blond woman at this Acme.  Mind you I was still in my dress pants and shirt from work.  This experience was so surreal.",0
2950326,2,"We had high expectations given the first impression upon walking in (and by the Yelp reviews), but E&E disappointed on almost every note.

We went early on a Tuesday and were seated right away. The interior is modern and hip, with cozy tall (overhead) round booths. The service was friendly and not overbearing. 

We started with the ahi sashimi appetizer and iceberg wedge. The sashimi was well seared, but was drizzled with a wasabi based sauce and another mild chili red sauce. It looked great, but I could have done without the sauces. Ahi tuna is a delicate taste, and was washed out by the oversaucing. The seaweed salad and ginger on the side were a nice and proper touch.

The iceberg wedge was simply an iceberg lettuce head, quartered, and served with a blue cheese dressing and some grape tomatoes. The dressing was notable, but otherwise the dish was not.

Our dinner specials came with caesar salads (the house salad-- which I found odd). I ordered mine with dressing on the side, and I'm glad I did. What came out was some chopped lettuce (romaine), with a smattering of grated parmesan, and (inexplicably) some multicolored tortilla strips. The dressing in the side cup was unappetizing, looking like oil mixed with mayonnaise. 

We should have taken the salads as a bellwether. When the entrees arrived, they were plated well, but many little things added up to a hot (overcooked) mess. The lobster tail was chewy and overcooked. There was some kind of breaded chunk atop the lobster tail reminiscent of a ""Rockefeller"" treatment, which tasted fine, but I didn't get why it was there. The sweet potato mash had apples mixed in, and was cloying (sweet potatoes don't need another fruit to make them taste good; take a cue from the name, chef!) The crab cake was the best part, with lump crabmeat, but it had the same drizzle as the sashimi app. Most of the spices and flavors they used were just ""off."" Too much going on on the plate.

The veg on both entrees was a mix of steamed broccoli, julienned carrots in some kind of sweet sauce, and edamame (flavorless and out of place on the plate).

The flounder piccata, while simpler, was also overcooked. It had the piccata sauce, but also some kind of smoky barbeque sauce drizzled alongside it. The corn mashed potatoes had a similar ""off"" spice/seasoning. 

The burger was cooked medium well (correctly) and the fries reminded me of Checkers fries, with an extra crispiness to them (perhaps finished in a convection oven).

The shift manager walked by once during the early part of the meal to ask how everything was. He barely broke his stride to actually wait for our reply, so at that time we did not have a composed answer.

A few minutes later, we did let the server know about the overcooked dishes, and he offered one free dessert. We opted for the bread pudding, which was on the special menu. It was fine, but served in an overly sweet caramel sauce.

To top it off, there is a compulsory 15% gratuity ""for your convenience"" (that was actually printed on the check). They've probably been stiffed by Canadian snowbirds who don't customarily tip, but restaurants that don't respect their patrons enough to tip properly leave a bad taste in my mouth.

Couple that with the *ACTUAL* bad taste in my mouth from the many mistakes that were made on the plate, and the high prices, and you understand the two star rating.",0

First off the manager (Sierra Walker)was just as bad as the staff and completely unprofessional! When she brought my drink to the table I said thank you and she said nothing. Then the food took so long to come out and it was empty so I couldn't understand. Then when is came out the guy was rushing us to clear the table. To the point he slammed the plate. I was pissed. Of course they didn't have our complete order! So I made the waitress aware and requested a manager. To my surprise the manager was the woman whom brought out the coffee with 0 manners. As I am watching the waitress and manager talk I get up and walk up to them as she seemed as if she wasn't coming. As I'm telling her my issues she didn't seem bothered at all so I just asked for their information and walked away. The FOOD!!?!?!?! Terrible! The steak was rough, the spinach wasn't cooked, and the eggs were cold. At this moment I'm quite over it. Sent the food back, at the avocado toast and let my family finish their food.

I have been to this joint in the past (way past) with my Mom while shopping in Brandon.  We would stop in and always enjoyed it but....it has been a long time.

My Dad, husband and I went a few weeks ago at my husband's request.  He used to own a small BBQ Catering business years ago and always like to try other places for comparison.  We ordered a plethora of items to share.  The best item? Of course, the potatoes!!  French fried po-tay-toes.  They are hand cut and fried once you order.  The rest of the meal, well, nothing to write home or here about.  Ribs were dry, chicken was dry, brisket was overcooked, coleslaw was ok and the collards were ok.

There's no service here (I mention this only because I saw other reviews about their service).  You order from the counter, they will bring to your table if it is not crowded (it wasn't) or you pick up from the counter.  The restrooms, gender neutral I believe, were cleaner than I expected.

They've been in business for 27 years and I see many reviews about how good their bbq is, maybe it was an off day, maybe some reviewers haven't owned a bbq business but it just wasn't for us.  With that said, 27 years is a long time and we wish them continued success.",0

As I approached the counter,  a young clerk (short blond buzz cut) approached the register, stopped in his tracks by the register, and establised eye contact.  I as became closer, he continued to maintain strong eye contact (no smile, no greeting, nada).  Seemingly annoyed that a customer came in as he was about to do something else. Weird.  It was as if, we were in mid conversation and I paused for a moment. 

Don't know what was on HIS mind, but being friendly or extending a simple greeting wasn't it.  Once I arrived at the counter, I paused, waiting for greeting, and he continued a ""blank stare"", as if to say...""AND...."".  So, I say, ""ok, hello...""   

I ordered my coffee, and while it was being made, two adult females with several ""active"" kids came in (reviewing coupons / deteriming what to do). Another clerk (taller, dark hair) walked to the register and greeted them.

The chicken doro wat looked and tasted like they stirred chicken shreds into yellow lentils.  No flavor whatsoever.  The beef looked and tasted the same, like beef stirred into yellow lentils.  The cabbage carrots and potatoes was good, but didn't make up for the other two.   I have eaten Ethiopian cuisine many times in over 7 big cities, and usually I love it.  This was awful. The waitress obviously didn't want to be there.  She was sullen and barely uttered a word.",0
6601763,1,"The decor is very nice and traditional but honestly the 3 dishes that I've ordered were not up to standard. The soup I had was not suppose to be extremely sour and the beef in the soup is traditionally tender but not here. The Hu tieu Phnom Penh soup I ordered was overly sweet and no vegetables were provided. Service was not the best even though it was only 1 other table there while one of their acquaintances came after us in a group of 6 had ordered after us but somehow got their food before us, mind you it was only I and another person. My gf ordered a drink when they came to take our order but when the food came out before the drink I started to wonder if it was still in the making or if they just forgot about it, it was the latter. Last but not least I don't think the quality of the food justified the prices. It's certainly not expensive but compare to a Vietnamese restaurant or a similar Cambodian restaurant in South Philadelphia, it's much more expensive. This may be a length review but I've heard so many compliments from other friends about this restaurant and it just doesn't live up to the hype.",0

NOT TODAY N ESPECIALLY AT THIS ONE!!

3709164,2,"I'm afraid I have to report that this restaurant has declined substantially in the quality of food. Service is okay. Wines by the glass leave much to be desired. We had an early dinner and walked away regretting the restaurant choice. I sent back the white wine I was served, which was much too young and flavorless. Then octopus dish was an absolute mess. The eggplant fries, the crown jewel of the chef when the joint opened years ago, did not resemble the original. It was watery and bland. Clearly it wasn't salted ahead of time, which would have drained the water.  We are not going back.",0
6436998,2,"I was pretty excited to try 54th Street Bar & Grill.... probably because I believe the hype I hear on the radio about ""Great new restaurants"". meh. First, let's talk atmosphere. The place immediately struck me as a mixture of Houlihan's (menu-wise) and Applebee's on crack (decor-wise).  I will give them credit- their menu is extensive. I heart nachos, so I tried their queso nachos and was honestly disappointed. Not enough cheese, bland everything, and they were cold. My party of 4 all had different food and all were ""okay"".  We were unimpressed, except with the size of their kitschy decor.  And what is up with the giant umbrellas?  Honestly, the decor is distracting.  The boys got some margaritas they enjoyed, so that's a plus. I'd only go back if I was desperate or had a coupon. And I'm rarely desperate and don't receive coupons...",0

Items were never ready Friday. I tried to call. No one picked up even though it was before 2pm. I tried again thinking it was busy. Someone picked the phone up and left it unhooked on the desk. I could hear them working on something in the background. Tried to call back but of course I couldn't get through. The app then stated hours later that it was delayed. Fast forward to Sunday, the day I can actually pick it up. App still says delayed. Called again after two calls I finally got through to costumer service. The lady cut me off, was rude, did not validate my frustration, and transferred me to shut me up. 

I then talked to Moleek in the back in pick up who was very nice and calming. She made a call and made sure my order was still in the system and hopefully it will be ready today.

6434439,1,"This is my second time visiting the Don CeSar. I combined business and pleasure. I thought the first trip last year was a fluke, it was bad, but I was convinced that new management would be an improvement. I was grossly overcharged for a minibar I didn't use except to store a couple of my own things. $26 per day for parking? Go pound sand. Also, the front desk said I received a complimentary upgrade as I offered to pay for an upgrade on two occasions, but if what I got was an upgrade then I desperately feel bad for the next step down in accommodations. Yes, I got a corporate rate, but I thought I'd treat myself. I could have booked my own separate new reservation for the room I wanted which was available, but because of a corporate rate, my concierge said no. Even AGAIN when I offered to PAY THE FULL PRICE. Hands down unacceptable. I found the pool bar staff rude but it could have been a rough day. But two years in a row? Moscow Mules come in cold copper cups, not a plastic solo cup thanks, it's not rocket science - and don't argue with your customers. I watched a bartender tell a customer he couldn't make a cosmopolitan at the pool bar. The food is on par with Olive Garden. Not terrible, but not up to par for the price point. I paid $150 for a dinner with two friends and was served frozen carrot cake, burned asparagus, undercooked boxed pasta, and salty mushy broccoli. Forgettable entree. Thank God they had good wine to take the edge off. The spa staff is nice, and the service is good but again, definitely not on par with the price point. The evening lobby bartender was rude and it was understaffed. One bartender for 50+ guests in the packed lounge? Also closing the bar on a Saturday night at 10:30 without a ""last call"" and while you still have 20 patrons is just rude. I was able to get one glass of wine in two hours, and it was a super warm Chardonnay even though I ordered a pinot gris. Gorgeous view when you get out back for a sunset, but don't charge me for a beach chair when your dumpy rooms are $400+ per night. It was so bad I left a day early and had an amazing stay at the Embassy Suites by the Tampa Airport. I will not be returning.",0

I have a close family member traveling, whose flight was cancelled and rescheduled last minute, so yes, we are last minute looking for airport transportation.

When I attempted to ask about safety, the person on the phone (again, condescending) referred me to the reviews and said, ""we wouldn't have been in business this long if we weren't good."" (paraphrasing).   Mid-conversation, I even tried to suggest that tact would be of benefit to the service, but the guy just doubled down on being a royal jerk.  Thankfully, we found another way to get my loved one home.

These days, I find such poor customer service everywhere.  I can't write a review for each one.  But this one particularly made me feel very bad.  I suggest to the manager/owner to find someone else to provide phone service.  I called at ~ 9:20 EST and spoke with a gentleman.

6225329,1,"Do you like being able to contact your landlords in the event of an emergency,  or having a property management company who you can work with? Well, this isn't it. We had a rental for a year and a half before being absorbed into JPM. We asked about a potential rate rase and how much it might be, so we can be prepared.  Nothing. Then, two month before the lease was up, they were going to raise the rate over $400 from our previous contract. (The unit that was attached to ours had new appliances, attached backyard,  while ours had appliances from the 1980s, a deattateched backyard, and they wanted us to pay more). We had pipes in the basement blow twice, on the second time it happened on the weekend we couldn't get a hold of anyone. After we moved into our house the saga didn't end. We were contacted by JPM regarding our security deposit. I will admit,  we did miss a few things. However,  what was stated in the receipt said more things had to be done, which we know we did, and only saw a fraction of the deposit back. Some of the items listed were already there from the previous tentative, and were put on us. No benefit of the doubt. I was contacted by JPM to see where they could send a check and we had a discussion about the items. We were sent certian pictures of things. But, like was stated above certian items they didn't send photos of was on the receipt on what they needed to do. It seemed their minds were made up before they contacted me and didn't intend to hear my argument. The JPM team didn't make an effort to inspect the unit after they acquired the property either. I know this rental market is nuts, but I would try to find another management company to go with. They don't care about you, only your money and they're going to try and suck as much as they can out of you.",0
1342226,2,"I am very disappointed. After doing business with Christie's for all kitchen and laundry room appliances for 30+ years and recommending this company to everyone I know, things have definitely changed. Usually, when I would call and ask if they had a certain product or what they recommended as a replacement for one, the salesperson was so very helpful. There were times I knew exactly what I wanted, ordered over the phone and came in to pay/make delivery arrangements. It was a breeze, and the new frig, washer, etc would arrive in days.
OK here we are in 2021. Yes, it is during the pandemic, but over a year in and things are normalizing to some extent. But the salesperson I spoke with on the phone seemed bothered he was even answering the call, kept telling me the model of my appliance was ""too old"" (duh we buy high quality appliances)  to give me a comparison on a new one, and then said there was not much to see at the store (as in ""don't shop here""?) When I asked when inventory would be in for me to look at, his reply was pretty unclear, stating things come in, get sold and they wait for more inventory. No timeline.
So, Home Depot got our business and we now have what we were looking for.",0

2562746,1,"Please read before eating there! I went there to pick up lunch today. I had eaten there once recently and hated the meat (it was tough and rubbery and a bit questionable) but I liked the egg rolls. As I sat in my car out front waiting for my egg rolls, an employee who was sitting inside eating lunch walked outside coughing (she had a greasy apron on so I assume she is a cook). Just as I was thinking, ""I hope she doesn't have TB"" she hocked up something large and green, and half caught it before it landed on the ground. Just a few feet away I sat in horror, as she then placed a finger on one nostril and blew a snot rocket that would have made any cowboy envious, straight into the parking lot. In my line of profession I deal with some pretty gross stuff, but this, this was bad! 

I instantly felt sick and should have just driven off at that point. But I waited, expecting to watch her go into the bathroom and hopefully wash her hands but instead she sat back down to eat. I went inside and I was going to say something but I was in such shock. I grabbed my bag of food and as I walked out she walked behind the counter back into the kitchen. She never washed her hands!! My food went immediately into the trash as soon as I got home. I can honestly say I have lost my appetite for any Chinese food, forever! 

There is ignorance, then there is just down-right dirty stuff. There is no excuse for not washing your hands after catching sputum from your mouth, then blowing snot out of your nose like a blowhole. The fact that she did this outside, in daylight with people sitting on the porch next to her raises serious concerns for what she does when no one is looking. Infectious diseases are easily spread through blatant carelessness like hers, and I will definitely be reporting this to the health department. So, now you have been forewarned. Eat there at your own risk.",0

4045025,1,"If I could give less than 1 star - I would.   The pictures are NOT what this park looks like.   I have current pictures - in the picnic area are OLD recliners, a broken exercise bike, and furniture falling apart.    There are several RVs with broken doors, windows and missing doors.   All of the weeds are brown and trashy.   The concrete is in need of repair.   Some of the RVs are on blocks.    Management is another issue.   She claims she is not the owner but the family owns this park.   The granddaughter lives there in the first RV where there is trash and toys everywhere.   She acts like a Nazi police patrol.   Loud music played throughout the weekend and she runs the office on the weekends.   The first month there, paid with cash and she was the one who took the money.  It suddenly disappeared - thank goodness I had the receipt.    It happened about the same weekend she got married.    Her little daughter will hang on the ""secured"" front gate so be careful when you go to open it.   She may get hurt or pinched on the gate.    A lot of the time - that ""secured"" gate is left wide open as is the back gate.   If the back gate works - maybe about 50% of the time, good luck.    The manager is Susan ( i.e. owner) - and she can be quite loud and rude.   She will not listen to anything you might ask or say.   In the beginning, her granddaughter told me that her parents owned the place and were letting Susan run it now.  It if all a family thing.  If her granddaughter says something - it is the law no matter what.    The manager's husband is quiet and very nice but he is whipped by Susan and her granddaughter into just being quiet.    In 8 months time - NEVER saw this park more than half full and it is a small park.   She claims she has already reserved every space for Hot August Nights although if you call to reserve, she will not take a hold or deposit.   When I mentioned that - she said I was a liar.    Go ahead and try.    If you are desperate - stay there but if you can find another place - run for it.    There is no real management there.    She changes stories around to suit her wants.   She says there is a 500,000 RV there that stays monthly - there is NO way this is a 500,000 RV.    Yes it looks pretty but it is not a new one and I worked with an RV dealer some and this is not that kind of RV.   Besides, if I had an expensive one, I would NOT stay at this dump.   Just because the Peppermill is across the street, the traffic getting there is crazy.    Can't wait to see how full this place is during Hot August Nights - bet not.    

There is also a tenant who is friends with the granddaughter and he was carrying a loaded gun yelling at someone.   Yet again - their ""secured"" gates are open most of the time.   Again, management makes up stories to suit the need.    She talks loud (as a previous reviewer said) and will not listen.    Read other reviews.",0

6988612,1,"On December 3rd, I ordered from Golden Corral on Door Dash, and my order included a 24 ounce of macaroni salad. When I received a 24 ounce container of macaroni and cheese, I immediately called the restaurant and spoke with a manager who apologized and told me to come in for the replacement. I went to the Golden Corral this evening to get some dinner to go from the line. When I went up front to pay for my food, I told the cashier about what happened with the macaroni salad, and showed her my order on the Door Dash app. The cashier was new, but kind, and she quickly went and got the manager (Joe). 

When the manager walked up, I started to tell him the story and he immediately became defensive and confrontational. First, he interrupted me and said, do you know the managers name. Then he interrupted me and said they don't sell macaroni salad there, as if he thought I was lying about the entire thing. Then he told me that I need to contact Door Dash because they do not handle any Door Dash issues in store. I continuously tried to explain that the manager of their restaurant never told me they didn't even sell macaroni salad and he asked me to come in, which is why I was there. Finally, he became frustrated and said, even if we sold macaroni salad, I would give it to you. I became upset, because I felt like he wasn't listening to anything I was saying and he came to the conclusion that I was some liar or cheat who was looking for free food. I then said to him that he was being disrespectful to me and that I did not even know if I wanted the food I had in front of me at the register. He then said, ""If you take the food without paying for it I will call the police and you will be arrested for theft. I then said, I already paid for my food, I was referring to getting a refund. He then said, I can make that happen. We started going back and forth about his threat. Then I asked the cashier to call Joe's manager. 

While I was waiting for Joe's manager, another customer walked up to Joe and said that he had been waiting for over 20 minutes for Joe's manager to come to his table because he received raw meet. Joe turned to him and said, ""well, he's busy."" The customer then said, ""he's too busy to speak to a paying customer about an issue."" The customer was standing the proof on his plate in his hand. Joe then told him that if he did not calm down he would call the police and have him arrested. The customer increasingly became upset because of the unwarranted threat, then Jose came out and calmed the customer down. The customer was still upset. He continued to yell at Joe as he made his way to the door. He said, ""whats your problem? You need to learn how to talk to customers. Your'e not supposed to treat customers like this."" Jose then walked up to speak with me. I explained the matter to him, and he immediately apologized. He told me that they no longer sell macaroni salad, and if I reach out to Door Dash they should resolve the issue. He basically said the same thing that Joe said, but with respect and sincerity. I then explained to Jose that Joe is rude and disrespectful and he does not know how to treat customers. I am a business major who has extensive restaurant experience, and I have never seen or dealt with a person like Joe. I felt offended by how Joe treated me. I felt the need to log in to my bank account to show Jose that I have a substantial amount of money, and that I was not looking to con anyone out of macaroni salad. Jose told me he believed me. 

Joe took a small issue and made it worse. Joe is emotionally unstable, he lacks customer service skills, but most importantly, he lacks people skills. He does not know how to effectively handle conflict, and he is actually skilled in escalating matters, not deescalating them. Joe is a liability and he visibly makes Jose's job harder. Jose had to calm both myself and the other customer down after Joe's failed attempt of resolving basic issues. Because of this experience, I will never eat at another Golden Corral again!",0
5501358,1,"Okay, I did give it a star as the A/C felt great on a hot day and it was on time.  
    This was my first time trying the bus in Santa Barbara since I went to school here 25 years ago.  Sadly, it's gone down hill since then.  
    Main problem was the driver.  Bigger woman on the #11 with earrings all over her face.  VERY rude and poor attitude.  Was rude to me, then as I sat there, I watched her be short and rude to almost every passenger that entered the bus and tried to ask her a question.  Shame on MTD for not training their drivers better.  This could be a nice experience with a good attitude driver.  Instead, I'm eliminating it from my list of transportation options.
    Bus was also pretty dirty.

488043,1,"On November 18, 2013 I purchased a car from Daren Tolbert of Montgomeryville Acura, in Montgomeryville, PA going against my better judgement. The opportunity to purchase this vehicle appeared to be a good deal at first, but after much deliberation I realized that it was much more of a nightmare. 
That night I leased a 2014 RLX and was able to drive it off the lot, however once I reached my destination I noticed that my CD case holding over a hundred cds was missing. I called the dealership and apparently they claimed that I had not left the cd case at the dealersip, which I highly doubt....and that was only the beginning.
While I waited patientlly for the dealership to prepare my registration and tags, I had temporary tags that were scheduled to expire on December 18, 2013. I waited for several weeks and still had not received my plates and registration. After contacting the dealership I was told if I received any tickets during this time, that they were happy to reimburse me. Of course to get to work and maintain my livelihood I was forced to contuinue driving in NYC without the proper documentation, with that I was stopped 4 times by police. After explaining the situation to law enforcement they were gratious enough not to give me a ticket because I had the proper paperwork which proved that I owned the car and also explained that I was waiting for my plates and registration. I emailed the dealership numerous times (to keep a papertrail that I contacted them) and to no avail. To my dismay it took them nearly 3 months for my registration and plates to come in the mail, which is simply unaccapetable. To add insult to injury they weren't the plates I requested. 
A very basic dealership transaction of trading in my car for a new car and having my custom plates transferred over as well, had turned into a disaster. 
The paperwork I completed was never submitted and in turn I was sent plates that I did not want. After contacting the dealership again both via telephone and email, they had to start the process all over again which took also another month in which this what I deemed ""simple process"" took approximately 4 months. Within those 4 months of frustration and anger I managed to accrue $300.00 in tickets and fines and my car was towed in which I was forced to cough up an additional $200.00 
When I contacted the dealership regarding ticket reimbursement due to their oversight (as promised when I purchased the vehicle) they refused to cover the ticket costs and deemed themselves not responsible.
This entire experience has been a nightmare. I should have leased my vehicle locally as originally planned of which I could have worked with a more efficient and reputable dealership that prizes customer service as their top priority. However, I took a chance on a dishonest dealership that lacks professionalism and does not value their customers. I will never do business with this dealership again and intend to inform people of my very negative experience doing business with them.",0

6902055,2,"Dear Pharmacy, please get over yourself.  It's a cool concept, and I've had a couple of pretty good meals there, but I likely won't return because I am just sick of the attitude.

 I *hate* the fact that you won't seat a party until everyone has arrived.  It's ridiculous, and the first time it happened, I almost left.  I don't like opening two tabs, I will have a cocktail at my table if you'll seat me while I wait the ten minutes for my companions to arrive, so you're losing revenue by worrying about turning the table.  The hostess the last two times I've been there has been really snarky about the ""rules,"" and so I have, not to be outsnarked, just stood there and blocked the door.  Ten minutes later, I was seated and a very pleasant waitress turned the experience around.  But that time, we didn't want anything special, just straight-off-the-menu fare as prepped.

But E. and I had dinner there recently and she was in a mood for grilled cheese.  There's a grilled cheese on the kid's menu, but the waiter pished about letting her order it, then ""went to check and see if we could do that,"" and naturally they could, but threw attitude like they were giving her a kidney.  When it arrived, it was horrendous.  One crappy slice of waxy (not even melted and gooey) American cheese between two greasy pieces of lukewarm bread-- for $4.  I am certain they did it to be pissy.  We gladly would have paid much more for a decent sandwich. You sell burgers.  Seriously.  You're a burger joint.  So they whole ""we don't do this,"" and ""we can't sub that"" thing from the kitchen is a little bit irritating. Nobody wants uppity at their burger joint.

The stroganoff burger is really tasty, the sausages are interesting and good solid food.  I like the sodas, and the corn relish is awesome.  But y'all-- it's a burger.  You're on the west side of Gallatin Road, and you won't be the hot new rage spot forever.  You might want to think about coming down from the high horse a bit.",0

Anyways, I like to come here occasionally for Sea Bass & a cocktail.
Went here last night and sat at the bar. I was THE only POC at the bar.
As I sat down, I could see the Bartender but he took a few minutes to even acknowledge me but he brought me a menu & took my drink order. My cocktail was brought to me with, no straw & no cocktail napkin and he walked off.
I don't care to drink directly from public glasses so I had to wait for him to return, after several minutes he returned, I asked for what I needed... and he literally, slides, damn near Threw a straw at me from across the bar. He then takes my food order. 
He returned and placed bread on the counter, from behind me... AND NEVER SPOKE TO ME AGAIN!
My food was brought out by a Server and I was Never asked if everything was Ok or if I needed ANYTHING else!
Later a female Bartender appears, there's a Non POC couple that comes in. She greets them (I didn't get that), offers to wipe down their area and proceeded to assist them. After making their drinks, she is nice enough to look my way, greet me & ask if I needed anything, so I ask if I could get a Togo box, she says Yes, walks away & then goes back to the couple to take their food order!
Meanwhile, another Non POC comes in any my original Bartender is FRONT & CENTER, present & eagerly awaiting to take their order, AND HE STILL HAS NOT SAID ISH TO ME!
I ask the female, once she's finished with the white couple, Of Course!! If I could get a Togo box! She brings it and then she comes back with my check!! No Asking for my telephone number for rewards & Never asking if I needed Anything else!! Oh & my $47 bill was paid with $100 & she brought me back all $5's & $1's!! Maybe All she had but did she bother to say anything! No!! So, my Casamigos Mule that I didn't finish, I poured into my plate & left!!! With a full piece of Sea Bass!! I'm 50+ years old & in my adult years I have Never left a restaurant without tipping 15-22%! Last night I left NOTHING & it saddens me!
I've been patronizing Bonefish restaurants since 2009 and this is absolutely the worst service I have ever received! Mission accomplished Bartenders!!

I wonder if many of the other positive reviews are genuine. 

Our experience was BAD: LOUSY food, HORRIBLE service (the lady couldn't recommend anything at all), the wait time (15 minutes) for what we got was ATROCIOUSly long. We ordered three different kinds of sushi. 

We expected fresh sushi, not old refrigerated sushi. The cashier lady was quick to grab sushi from the refrigerator. If we wanted refrigerated sushi we could have gone to Target or some other food store and saved more than half of what we paid here. Regardless, the other two kinds which the chefs prepared during these 15 minutes were NOT GOOD to say the least. The rice was weird tasting and the fish had an UNPLEASANT chemical aftertaste. I was convinced that the fish either went bad or was ready to go bad, and the chefs used some solution that smelled like CHLORINE to hide the fact that the fish WASN'T FRESH. The sauce or whatever was on top of the sushi was SOUR tasting not in a good way.

I was so thankful that we didn't get food poisoning! We paid nearly $50 for not-so-fresh food , how about that?!  Whole Foods makes better sushi though not much cheaper than what this place is charging. Wouldn't recommend.",0

We were seated on the patio within 20 minutes (on a Saturday around noon) which was impressive but the rest of the experience did not match. The service was extremely slow and I noticed that to be a theme for all on the patio. Our server lacked the necessary intuition for being in hospitality and was very awkward and/or unmotivated and/or confused on where she was and how she got there. I ordered an iced coffee and she forgot about it- when I reminded her I received it in about a minute so I know it was ready to be picked up at the well. Not sure if their coffee is naturally sweetened or just different but it had a unique taste- that of 2-3 sugar packets. When I asked our server about the coffee she just looked very confused, shook her head and told me the barista didn't sweeten it. No, she didn't ask if I would like to try something else.

My smoked salmon Benedict was pretty pathetic- not much flavor happening and the muffins they're served on are way, way too thick. Muffin overkill. Mike enjoyed his chorizo omelette and it was pretty tasty (thanks to the goat cheese).

2769820,1,"My experience with Dr. Krystal Nguyen at Krystal Vision Eye Care was utterly disgraceful. I paid the copay under my insurance for my daughter and I to have a contact lense examination, My daughter was examined first. Following her examination, I was brought in to see the doctor. During the initial exam, Dr. Nguyen misquoted my benefits information. I corrected her. She claimed to have verified my benefits and told me that my interpretation of those benefits was incorrect. I argued the issue with her and she reprimanded me.

 I allowed her to complete my eye exam but made no purchases. I did agree that she could order contacts for my daughter because the facility did not have her prescription in stock. 

I went home and contacted the insurance company which verified my interpretation. The insurance company called Krystal Vision Eye Care and notified me that I should return. When I arrived, the gentleman who makes the glasses was gone for the day and the office attempted to claim that I owed an additional $25 in copays. I asked to see the doctor and was refused. I became quite angry but left with nothing other than a raised voice.

I calculated the difference between what I should have paid and what Krystal Vision Eye Care attempted to make me pay and Krystal Vision Eye Care would have overcharged me by $200.

I then called the insurance company again and verified that I could use the remainder of my benefits at another provider. I made the contact with the other provider immediately.

I then received a phone call from Krystal Vision Eye Care informing me that Krystal Vision Eye Care had refunded my money and would not release the prescription for my daughter. She will need to undergo another exam.

527031,2,"My husband and I backpack in national forests quite frequently, and our goal is always to leave them cleaner than we found them. Most recently, we went on a car camping trip with friends. These are the same friends we car camped with near Mommoth, Sequoias, and most recently the Los Padres National Forest. 

We were quite disappointed by the amount of trash we saw everywhere on this trip. The very first night it was just my husband and I and we camped in the lower Los Padres. Just as we were setting up our tent, we look down to see a pile of human feces. Upon looking around, we saw other areas of used toilet paper. We figured it was because it was so close to the road.

However, the next day we met up with our friends and camped closer to the Big Sur area, still in the Los Padres N.F. Again, it was impossible to find a camp area out of sight of open piles of feces and mounds of used toilet paper. Very disappointing. Also, gas on U.S. 1 sold for $6.50 gallon and ice was $4 a bag.

Other people were seated after us and received meals before us. The waitress barely stopped by to give refills and then a male worker with a Trjdent shirt walked up and told us that they messed up on our nachos and were remaking them so it would be another 5 minutes. (We asked for nachos with beef. Not anything out of the ordinary). They were waiting on the burger so they could come out together. 

1. The nachos came out and they were awful. I can't fathom how one can mess up nachos but, things happen. The nachos came out ""fixed"" and had chicken on them mixed with beef and it looked like rather then remaking the nachos they just picked the chicken off. Not to leave out that the broiler burned them and it was still brought to the table. 

2. The burger we ordered was over cooked and not medium at all. 

3. While we were waiting for our meal we could see a man working the food/cooking line and was chewing food while prepping food. Not really sure what he was chewing but, it was definitely something from the station. 

4. Within 1 hour after the meal my stomach started hurting and has not stopped since. I won't assume but, I do have to associate this meal as the contributor because I have not eaten anything since the morning and the gut issues happened before even leaving here. Just be careful if you do eat here. I am not sure what's going on behind the cook area but I do have questions with seeing cooking staff eating while cooking.

Ditto for the meatballs with cacciacavallo cheese inside. No amount of pomodoro or cheese overkill on the outside could mask the fact that inside the meat was dry and overcooked.

After watching the show as we all did to get here....we raced ACROSS town to check it out. First impression, really unkept entrance, mismatched chairs attempting to channel beatnik vibes. I think the decorator missed the point but I moved past it.

A few people waiting no big deal. Got in line behind a single group of 3 guys. 

The gal that everyone on the reviews has encountered was our host at the register. She appeared irritated with the questions about the menu.

We moved our way to the back as we had 3 adults and 3 kids. 30 minutes later still no pizza and no salad. I asked and was told by the owner he assumed we wanted to eat the salad which is on its way out now. I cannot describe this so called chicken salad in great detail but what I can tell you is I kept hearing in my head the voice of Anthony Bourdain is ""what the F*** is that ??!!"". Really!!?? it has soaking lettuce with curry chicken which should be indicated somewhere as I do not care for it. It had a pile of dried ramen noodles thrown on top of it. The chicken was so dry even with the sauce on it. Also had a lemon wedge and shaved cantaloupe. I ask you (owner) What is the intent with this salad??? what are you going for? The two pieces of dried bread had some sauce on it that I cannot put my finger on. I'll post a picture as soon as I figure out how on here. I told them that we had 3 kids starving....why does a 12 inch pepperoni pizza take so long? PMind you the 3 guys had already finished their meal. The pizza arrived finally and the gal that was super irritated threw it on the table and threw her arms up in the air and walked away without saying anything. This is exactly the behavior described in the other reviews. 

The floor was really dirty and so were the tables EVEN though a young man kept walking in circles around the restaurant.

My partner ordered the Gumbo. It was bland and watery. Seriously - horrible. It seemed majorly under-seasoned. For his entree: they were out of soft-shell crab AND the speckled trout, so he got the gulf fish. This was actually OK - but VERY rich. The side salad was OK - but, um - it's salad. 

With my order - I wanted the Crab Imperial. But I was debating between the Crawfish Etouffee and the Jambalaya as well. So I asked the waitress for her recommendation and she told me, ""Do 1/2 Crab Imperial and 1/2 Jambalaya!"" She was so enthusiastic about this! This option wasn't on the menu and it seemed like a great way to try both. So I went with it.

Crab Imperial: $33
Jambalaya: $12

(Oh, and the Crawfish Etouffee would have been $21.50).

How did my bill total $33 for 1/2 of each of these? I feel like the waitress pushed this on me on purpose - to save a buck. 

Crab Imperial was pretty good. Jambalaya - bland and under-seasoned. Both were VERY small portions. 

Also, I eat seafood - but not meat. I made this very clear - which is why I was extremely disappointed when the veggie of the day (mustard greens) came out with bacon on it. She couldn't have mentioned this when I was ordering??

I left hungry and angry.

Horrible service. Mediocre food. High prices. 

I don't mind spending money on QUALITY food. This was NOT QUALITY.

But at least the space is intimate...",0
1738737,2,"This was my second time coming to this place.  The first time was good, but this time was terrible.   We had a middle aged guy, Boyd, as our server.  Boyd was really bad and then flat lied to us about some issues with the check.   The list of issues are below

- Originally taken to a dirty table until we said no
- did not get silverware for minutes after the food was delivered.  Had to request that twice
- took more than 10 minutes to take drink orders
- put in the wrong food order
- didn't make much of an attempt to correct it other than say ""I can get you that sauce if you want""

And finally where the lie came in.    He said I spoke with my manager and they adjusted the bill.   We didn't check until after we paid and realized that they did none of that.   

Enjoyed  the food, but dang Boyd need a whole lot of retraining.   By the way, this was a Tuesday.",0

All they had were Banh-Mi's, which I regret purchasing because they barely put any meat in them.",0
1912084,2,"I seriously can not give more than 2 stars for this place. I miss a good Chicago dog every now and again- I feel like I have to refresh my Chicago roots whether it's by Fedexing deep dish or trying to find a nice Chicago style hot dog. So, after reading about another place in Nashville that serves up a Chicago style dog I had to go. $4.50 for a Chicago style hot dog. FOUR PERIOD FIFTY?! 
1/2 of me wanted to leave, 1/2 of me wanted to hug the owner and wonder who abused them in childhood to charge that much and the other 1/2 of me wanted to hit him. 

I know you can't have 3/2 but I didn't think anyone would charge 5 bucks for a Chicago hot dog either. At this point, I was like 'the hell with it' and got a combo-fries and a drink and it was almost 10 bucks. Granted, it was a pretty large dog, probably a quarter pounder but, I'm sorry, a Chicago hot dog: simple, delicious fare is supposed to be a nice, cheap, complete meal in a bun. You should be able to feed a family of 4 for under 10 bucks with a Chicago hot dog (provided they don't like ketchup.) 

The dog was pretty good, it was pretty authentic but I couldn't get the bitter taste of WTF out of my mouth.

Also, there's Sox stuff all over the place. Who cares if they won a World Series in the past century? Go Cubs!",0

pal o'mine and i went in on a Rock Tits night to see old friends, and to generally have awesome chick time. after a couple of rounds paying cash, we decide to batten down for the long haul and open a tab.

big motherfucking mistake, apparently.

i drank lager, she drank bud throughout the night, until a dude we'll call Huge Drunk Dude moseyed on up and asked if he could buy us shots.

well, duh, dude. sure...why the hell not? he was pretty harmless, and it was clear he was just that guy who buys strangers drinks. no harm, no foul, etc...

forward to about an hour later, we buy our owndamnselves a round of shots.

forward to an hour later, when we ask for the check, and one more shot each.

check is given, check is fucked up. there are a couple of extra beers on there, and the shots that Huge Drunk Dude ordered are also present. i bring this up to the bartender, and he, of course, fights us on it. Pal pays up anyway, and we leave, fuming.

here are salient points that make me NEVER want to go back:

1. both of us work in the business, so we know how to keep a tab straight.
2. i, being the ridiculously anal person i am, keep a tally of what i drink when i open a tab. i don't like surprises, you know?
3. when presented with the problem, the bartender said straight up that we were wrong.

2270689,2,"Decided on Mt Fuji after a considerable Yelp search looking for good Japanese on the main line.  Reviews looked right and I respect everyone's opinion.  We ordered about 10 or more varieties of sushi and rolls and were greatly disappointed.  

Now, I hate to say anything negative re a restaurant that is clean, the wait staff are pleasant and supportive, and this place had all that. Furthermore, a member of our party ordered a teriyaki dish w shrimp and scallops that looked absolutely delicious.   

I've eaten sushi all over the world, and have had some pretty bad stuff...., but by the same token, we've had sushi that's been profoundly good and nearby as well.  I respect everything that everyone has written about this place, but today the sushi was awful.  Perhaps the regular chefs were out and the replacements had little experience. Here's what we found:

1) The sushi was warm or room temperature, not cold or even cool which kind of turned my stomach.

2) The rice was all wrong and would barely stick together.  Each piece fell apart when picked up by chop sticks and fingers alike.  

3) They stuck pieces of green leaf lettuce in rolls that,...well, just didn't belong!

4) The sauce on the spider roll was just all wrong.  

5)  The rolls looked awful, were unbalanced, the rice wasn't sticking together,  Although large, they looked like something from a Chinese buffet.  

6) The presentation was nonexistent.  Pieces were placed squarely on a square and rectangular plate w out any garnish or artistic flare whatsoever.  I mean, this in itself is probably not bad, but in combination w everything else, all the other issues were just compounded.  

PLEASE FORGIVE ME!!!  We won't be eating at Mt Fuji again.",0

6744991,2,"This place needs some work in respect to the quality of basic amenities expected of a hotel. While the hotel staff are friendly and respectful, the quality of the hotel in respect to the price that guest pay was inequivalent. As a frequent traveler, I was quiet disappointed with my stay.  During my weekend stay, I experienced a shower without hot water as well as a broken air conditioning unit.  In the first room that I was assigned to, the shower water was ice cold, and did not heat as expected. When I called down to the front desk to have the shower looked at and fixed, I was told that they would come up to the room to fix it before 9pm. After stepping out for dinner and returning to the hotel room at 10:30pm, I tested the shower, and again, the water was ice cold. I then called down to the front desk again to see if they ever sent someone to the room, and admittedly so, they had not.  i then was moved to another room down the hall with a working shower, however as a trade-off the air conditioning unit was broken. Again the next day i called down to ask if the AC unit could be fixed, however my request were ignored. 

I hope this feedback will be utilized to improve the quality of rooms and service provided for others who may choose to stay at this establish. However, sadly due to my experience staying at this hotel this weekend, this is not a hotel I would recommend to others to stay while visiting the city of brotherly love.",0

The new space is nice, lots of light but the ambiance is totally lacking. There was a juke box, but since no one was requesting songs, there were several periods with no music whatsoever. There seemed to be something fun going on in the back room, TVs and laughter, but our area was boring (no TV, no music).

The server approached our table and said nothing, it was awkward. She was standoffish, offered no help with the menu & couldn't tell us what dressings were available for the salad. She did tell us that they were out of anything charbroiled... Disappointing because we wanted Oyster Rockafeller to start.

I am not sure how long the food took but the table next to us sat down after us, got their appetizer & entrees before we got any food. I ordered a salad but it came out with my entree, which honestly defeats the purpose for me. The only reason I order salads out is because I can't wait for something to cook!!

Finally, the menu boasted a gumbo full of chicken, craw fish, shrimp & sausage but none of the seafood was present. My cheese steak was served on burnt bread & the meat was over done/ dry. The salad was fine; iceburg, a few tomatoes & onions... Nothing special.

The worst part of the evening (besides not having a liquor license!) was when we told the server that we were disappointed with the food. She apologized & sent the manager over. The ""manager"" was wearing sweats & flip flops. He had an aggressive tone with us & basically said that the food was exactly how it should be. He offered to take off half of the cost of the entree at the end, but I didn't want anything for free, I wanted seafood! I wanted to be heard, and understood with empathy- even if it was fake.

The salad was on it's last legs and the dressing was clearly foodservice grade.  The beans were watery and non-descript.  My son seemed to enjoy his 'big' burger, but that's not saying much as he normally orders from the kids menu so just the fact that I let him order the 'big' burger was enough to make him happy.

The bathrooms were dirty and in dire need of both repair (door didn't lock) and updating.

The cutting off of the ties and hanging them on the wall is cute but not enough to bring me back or recommend it to friends.

Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant except maybe for dessert. the area is very cute and we went and had our pics taken at the old-time photo shop, very fun and great souvenir of our visit to Tucson!",0
6876843,1,"The visits with my doctor were great. No complaints, there. Billing however is a NIGHTMARE.
No matter what you say or PAY or do - they'll continue to harass and bill you. 
I was charged an errant charge. I called and wrote countless times, asking for the charge to be removed from bill. Still to this day, I continue to be charged for the errant fee, no matter what was said or noted from my calls.
The last call: I lost my job due to COVID-19. I was told they'd remove all the finance charges and would only owe a small amount to close out my bill (which still includes the fee they refuse to remove). And! I was told I could wait until June to pay. What do I receive? A new bill--complete with new fees, late charges, finance charges, etc. So now - Monday: I'll need to call for what might be the 30th? time? I've lost count. CRIMINAL. They should be ashamed. It's harassment at this point. 
I guess I could go to small claims to try to get the money I overpaid back. But I have to call again Monday to at least get them to follow their word on removing the finance charges, etc. Why is my bill $30 more after they told me they'd freeze it due to the virus and job-loss issue? What a joke. Absolutely terrible.",0

5829076,1,I stopped in for Happy Hour. I saw the signs out front saying half price apps and thought let's give it a try. I ordered the Chilli chicken which was $14 but only $7 during happy hour and they had draft beer for $1.50. At first I thought this is awesome I couldn't understand why only 5 people were here. At these prices place should be packed. The beer was ice cold but so was the Chilli chicken. I sent it back and even after they heated it up it was cold so again I asked for the dish to be fixed then when they gave me the dish again the chicken was rubbery. I made mention and the bartender tells me that since they microwaved the dish the chicken got rubbery. No Thanks!!!,0
86889,1,"This was our first--and last--time at Blake's Lotaburger, for a number of reasons.

When we arrived, the place was packed. Parking was at a premium, but we wanted to eat in, so we finally found a place to park. There was a long line inside, and it was moving VERY slowly. We were on line for approximately 18 minutes before we finally made it to the counter. Once there, we placed the order we'd had plenty of time to think through. We both ordered the Lota combo. He asked for nothing on his burger except cheese and onions; when asked if they had any other sauces for the burgers, like maybe, 1000 island, they did not. I have gluten issues, and asked if they have gluten-free buns; they do not. I ordered mine bunless. The combo comes, according to the menu, with a large drink and a large fries. Their large drink is something like 30 ounces, but their large fries is smaller than a regular size at certain large chain restaurants. The price was fairly reasonable, no real complaint there.

We went off and found one table to sit down at to wait for our food. The dining room is far too small for the numbers of people wanting to check out this new restaurant (that may not be a problem for long, however). There are no salt or pepper shakers, no available napkins on the tables or in the dining room.

There was a young man running orders out to the tables, and it was at this point that I realized how backed up they really were. Our order number was 844; the runner was bringing out orders in the low 830's. People who had already found tables before we entered the restaurant were just getting their food (at this point, we'd already been in house approximately 25 minutes). It took approximately another 15 minutes to get our food. When we got it, our first disappointment was the fries. Not that they were unpleasant; they were not particularly hot, more along the line of lukewarm, and they could have used a bit more salt. When he opened his burger, there was cheese, but no onions. He had to go to the counter for it, and wound up with the equivalent of the small round of onion. The patty was thin and dry, and we were both disappointed at the fact it was only one patty. The picture next to the Lota combo clearly shows a double patty burger. When he asked about it, he was told they have had a large number of complaints about that.

Over all, the experience was far less than all the hype had led us to expect. We won't be going back. If we want a good burger, we'll go to Graze across the street.",0
2611311,1,What a disgrace this restaurant is. I ordered a shiva tray and it was suppose to be delivered yesterday. The address was one off and the restaurant delivered it to the next door neighbor. Now here is where the story is unbelievable. The person who got it said the ste was no card and the driver didn't tell them who it was for. He said he asked and the driver said someone sent it. The driver told the restaurant he told him who it was for and that the person said he would take it to the family. Why would the driver let him. It was a lot of food. We had to order another dinner and they charged us twice. They were leaving a family sitting shiva with no dinner,0

My main issue is that we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and book again for our July event.  They TRIPLED the room rental rate.  Upon calling hotels right across the street and down the street I have learned this is a common practice for this hotel.  They were dishonest about it and are price gouging.

4729552,1,"You only get married once. We had our rehearsal dinner at Union 50. We even had our families meet for the first time at dinner at Union 50, (we live out of town) to show them the venue, and experience what we thought would be a fantastic way to start our wedding weekend.

At that time, we were walked through the restaurant and given the options and enjoyed our first family dinner with an amazing meal. The event coordinator, Lindsey Stewart - told us in person, we would be able to utilize the far left side of the restaurant as along with the outdoor patio, pending weather. We were beyond excited! The food had been amazing and of course the atmosphere there is great. Proud to show Indianapolis off to our friends from all over, and immediately, we booked it. 

The night of our rehearsal dinner after many emails back and forth, we arrive to see the entire outdoor area filled with strangers having their dinners. The venue did not hold our space outside. Upon walking into discuss this, one would think the event planner would be awaiting our arrival to great our 60 plus party. Yet, when we arrived we had to wait to speak to anyone - we, being the bride and groom. We literally walked it with Lindsey in person with our parents when we booked the venue. Yet, she blatantly said, ""No I never did that"". I am still appalled. We did not have sole access throughout the night. However, they did eventually stop serving dinner outside. They also did not have the projector that was specifically told would be there for our video, and had to rush it in, making my sisters/the maids of honor miss most of their dinner to scramble, & argue with her in while doing so. 

The staff, who obviously had been told nothing, were helpful and tried to assist when during the father in laws speech as random strangers were passing in front of him to get to the bathroom. Eventually, they realized and escorted people through the back of the bar area, although he had to cut it short, due to all the interruptions.

Sad to say the space itself is gorgeous and the food was fantastic. However, Union 50 is not equip yet to handle private parties, nor should Lindsey be the contact for those hosting. This is an event you get once in your life, and I am sad to say it will not be a pleasant memory of a venue. Very disappointing.

Would not recommend for hosting any sort of event until they learn the proper way to cater to customers.",0

5764629,2,"The first thing to note is what stands out the most about the Village Cinema; the quality of the venue. It's a beautifully designed building and its apparent how much they spent on the whole Village project. A great new look for Boise and That's the positive. Unfortunately that's virtually where the positive side of things end. We took advantage of the VIP seats in order to take part in the food and alcohol. The food offerings at first glance seemed to be extensive, especially for a movie theater but upon further inspection is not much more than a few apps and overpriced ""entrees"". I ordered the Salmon Panini and my wife the Mac and Cheese w/bacon. The panini wasn't bad taste-wise, just a little small for me. Overall good taste, but definitely not an entree as the menu indicated. Also, no sides were included with this full priced ""entree"". The Mac and Cheese arrived and my wife noticed it was cold. Very Cold. Being that it's a movie theater there wasn't much of a wait staff to come and check on how everything was, so common  to most food serving venues. This led me to have to leave the theater to find an employee to attempt to have my wife's dish reheated at the very least. Their microwave must have been malfunctioning that night because upon re-arrival the mac and cheese was still cold. Not a great first impression and after spending $70+ on a movie with cold entrees that were actually appetizers and overpriced alcohol, it seemed 2 stars is all The Village Cinema deserved.",0

2780554,1,"The reasons for my one star review:
1. They used dipping powder on me, which I have come to find out is ILLEGAL in the state of Idaho. It was not placed in a separate bowl, instead my unclean fingers were dipped in the container and then sealed up when all done. I'm assuming everyone before me had the same experience. Not ok!
2. My nail technician did not give me a manicure! There was no cuticle work done whatsoever, so within days the growth was so obvious. At $40, you think that would be included.
3. My technician also didn't know how to shape short nails. They looked like tiny round M-n-Ms stuck on my nails. I had to file them down and reshape them myself at home.

Having found a true professional since my visit here, I've learned what a good manicure entails.",0

Is it possible they perfected begging telepathically?

I had the cucumber buttermilk soup but felt a little weird after I ate it. We had there homemade potato chips and they were good not great. I ordered the snapper and it was bland. The sauce did not complement the fish at all. One friend got the tenderloin and loved. My other two friends are vegetarians and said there food tasted weird. I also had to constantly remind the waitress to refill my drink which I hate. Lastly, I love bread at nice restaurants and I noticed other tables had bread.

The issue started with the hostess who was openly hostile then it spread to the wait staff who appeared to be loyal to her colleague.  The food was not as good as I remembered but that might have been due to how uncomfortable the staff made us feel. I do know that I could not eat the brussel sprouts, they were terrible. The fried chicken sandwich was tasty and the pretzel was ok. Our food, appetizers and entree, came at the same time so it was not a leisurely dinner. Half way in the hostess turned on the heaters (for no reason we could think of other than to annoy us) so that was pretty unpleasant. - It was one of those rare Santa Barbara nights when it stays around 70 and the air is perfect.  - When the waitress came to clear our dishes, the only time we saw her, we told her the brussel spourts were bad and she replied ""well you should have said something""   -  the openly hostile vibe was not something we wanted to engage in on a beautiful Friday night in SB so we smiled and said nothing.

940555,2,"I was really looking forward to trying this place after hearing good things.  They offer samples of any cookie dough flavor before you purchase it, which is nice.  I tried the chocolate chip cookie dough, and ended up purchasing one scoop of that.  The sample was so good.  Unfortunately, when I got my scoop the cookie dough began thinning out within 10 minutes and became mush.  Unfortunately it no longer tasted like cookie dough anymore.  So I threw away the 2/3 of the scoop that I didn't have a chance to eat yet.  The same thing happened to the cookie dough flavors that my two friends ordered.  We didn't say anything, but I just won't be returning.  Also, the prices are steep. $10 for a sundae, $7.50 if you want two scoops.  I'm only giving it two stars because they offered two free toppings on the day we went.",0
4143968,1,"I have a package home maintenance insurance policy with Fast that includes plumbing; apparently sort of.  I had a Kohler toilet flush handle that was sticking.  They sent a plumber out to fix.  Didn't have the correct handle so he had it ordered.  I never heard back from Fast, so I finally called them.  They called back the next day to advise that they would order the handle but I would have to pay for it!!  I couldn't understand why I had to pay for the handle since I had plumbing insurance, but that was what I had to do, so I agreed. The plumber returned with the part, fixed the toilet satisfactorily, and gave me the bill for the handle.  The service call was covered by the insurance.  I was charged $26.45 for the handle.  After he left, I googled the handle part number and found that I could have bought it at any number of places for under $10 RETAIL!!!  So that is why I am giving Fast one star; I feel I've been scammed.  

Also, my whole house filter housing was stuck and wouldn't come off.  The filter housing was not even covered under the insurance.  And I also found out that, after 10 years when you may start needing repairs on your central air, Fast won't repair under your insurance; they give you a $1,000 credit (I believe) towards a NEW SYSTEM that THEY have to install.  And everyone knows they are one of the most expensive companies to get an HVAC system from.  So make sure you understand just what you are getting coverage for when you buy one of Fast's policies.",0

5637606,2,"Note: This review is based over two visits. 

First visit: 4 out of 5 stars- 

Good service for a particularly bad day for me. Asian food is my comfort food and I love Pad Thai. So my husband and I went. Not busy and we were served right away. In fact we were halfway through our spring rolls when the main entrees came. The service was quick, efficient and the waitress attentive. Well worth the money spent.


Second visit: 1 out of 5 stars - 

I'm not entirely sure what happened on our second visit, only that the wait time was excessively long. Maybe it was our fault for going on a Saturday, but seeing as it was definitely past the busy part of the evening, it should not have taken nearly 45 minutes for an order of Pad Thai and Crab Fried Rice to arrive from the kitchen. Not to mention that my entree, the Pad Thai, was not made correctly (no green onion, no tofu). I spent part of my meal picking out the green onion. 

While the waitress offered to have it remade, I had no assurances that it wouldn't take another 45 minutes for it return and making my husband wait as I ate. We never saw the waitress again until we wanted the check. We were seated in the back of the restaurant where the restrooms were so maybe that had something to do with it.

Overall:

The food is good, but if our last visit is an indication of the level of service, we may just go elsewhere for Thai food.",0

3728274,1,"I really want to like this place. Everyone is super cool, laid back, and it is decently priced. But, they really screwed up the back of my hair, and didn't say anything. In fact, avoided showing me the back.  
But, sad to say, really disappointing. I went for a cut and color, and they totally botched it. I wear my hair in a bob, with blonde balayage towards the end. I met with Kali, she seemed to totally understand what I wanted. Just a few inches off the length to bring it up around my chin, and to bring up the balayage that had grown out. 
Kali was super easy to talk to, and I really enjoyed being her client...but her work...
Ok, I get it. It's cheap, so I can't expect the highest quality color. The blonde ended up chunky and streaky, rather than a smooth gradient into blonde. Whatever, I figured I would live with it and get it touched up by someone else in a few weeks. The cut was fine, no big deal, it was a bit shorter, it was a mediocre bob. I paid and left. It wasn't until I left, met up with a friend, and they asked ""what happened to the back""
then i realized....Kali never showed me the back. Ok, what kind of hair dresser does that? The kind of hair dresser who knows she messed up. It totally slipped my mind to even ask .She cut extremely short layers in the back, giving me a wedge haircut. Were there layers before? No. Were there layers in the rest of my hair? No. This was a sloppy haircut.  
Did she color the back of my head? Barely. In fact, she had cut out much of the blonde at the end, and only colored it in streaks. It was an entirely different hair cut and color than the front. If I had understood really how bad the back was, I would not have left the salon. 

I can live with a bad cut. I can live with bad color. The combination of the two...and then trying to HIDE IT? Kali you clearly knew you screwed up. So sneaky, and disgustingly unprofessional. Talking Headz, you get one star.",0

I grabbed my food and left only to find out they missed about 3 things and overcharged us on 1 item.  Remember I'm on my lunch break...so I call them up and they say come back and we will give free dessert.  So I go back and the guy hands me back the bag.  Still missing items...so again ask him to correct the items he missed.  Now we finally have our order correct and the guy now needs to give me my money back for the over charge.  So now the people who were frustrated by their lack of service for lunch are now waiting in line to pay at the register.  About 6 to 8 people all frustrated.  

The guy who was helping me knows he owes me a refund to complete our transaction but decides he's going to clear the line of waiting patrons prior to getting me out of there.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The complete lack of customer service.

Finally after about 4 people I'm like sir I only have a limited am out of time due to my break and I need my refund.  He refused and I left pissed off...

A couple weeks later after leaving my real name several times and not getting a return call from Sam to explain my frustration (again taking my time to help him).  So on the final attempt I left a fictitious name to see if Sam would call me.  Sure enough 5 minutes later I get a call from Sam and to boil down a very frustrating conversation into a quick summary here are his excuses for the bad service.

1.  New waitperson.  I told him he set her and his customers up for failure.
2.  Said he has been running the business for 15 years and these things happen.

He proceeded to tell me that he would take care of me if I came in.  All good except after I told him I used a fake name the last time I called (didn't return my other calls with my real name).  He freaks out that I used a fake name and goes on and on about using a fake name...blah blah blah..won't let me explain that every time I used my real name I wasn't getting a call back...honestly I don't think he even heard anything over his non stop ranting about using a fake name...

596165,2,"The food was ok but the portions are not reasonable for the price.  The bowl is small (and I'm a 5'4 female and not a huge eater).  The other problem is the price is $12 for all bowls regardless of protein choice.  So we chicken and tofu eaters are subsidizing the bowls of those sushi-grade tuna eaters.  They really should have a lower price like $10 for chicken and tofu bowls.   They also barely give you any protein.  I had two tiny scoops of chicken., maybe 4 ounces total.  You would think at least they'd give you more chicken since your protein choice is cheaper but no.

The last gripe is that you only get 3 toppings and they counted a teaspoon of wonton strips as a topping.  Seriously?

The toppings are interesting and unique.  Seaweed was good. I love the glass noodles that I chose as my base.  They could use a little more mainstream variety.  For example the pickled carrots were weird. 

The spot is clean and welcoming and the teas are great, but as a non-tuna eater, I won't be back until the reprice the chicken bowls or adjust the portion size for chicken.",0

When I called the company to let them know about it, they defended the employee's actions saying that he didn't know he could go into the back yard if I wasn't home. That's so funny because I had never been home when they came to spray. This time I was home and chose not to answer the door thinking he would just go ahead and spray. He not only didn't spray he made no mention on the bill that he didn't spray. Then I was told I would have to pay for the service I didn't get. When they say money back guarantee don't believe them. I told them to cancel my service. That was Oct. 2014. I had had seasonal service so come March 2015 I got a notice that Burns was coming out again. I called them to tell them that I had canceled my service last year. They said they would take care of it. Well they didn't, they came out anyway. I called them again and they said they would take care of it. Finally, I wrote an email to them. They apologized and then sent me another bill. Are you kidding me? What does it take to get rid of this company. I may have them arrested for trespassing next time. I have never dealt with either incompetence or devious business practices like this before. Beware, you may get their service and then never be able to get rid of them.

4510918,2,"Dr. Jennifer Vicente, DDS is an excellent dentist. However, my experience with her incompetent staff left me wondering about her priorities. And I love that she employs her family in her front office but that shouldn't come at the cost of good service and customer satisfaction.
My experience started well as I noted in my initial review. It was later when I went in for some dental work that the cracks began to show.
First, I waited nearly 45 minutes after my appointment time for the doctor to begin my procedure. Then it became obvious to me pretty quickly that the technician working with Jennifer was new to the job. I had to repeatedly motion to the tech to clear my throat before I began choking. It seemed to me that she wasn't much interested in her job or didn't know how to do he job. And the constant banter between Jennifer and the tech was annoying even though I was on nitrous. By the way, the nitrous is a great service that Jennifer offers for a very low fee. I will never have work done without it again.
Jennifer took a 30 minute break during my procedure and told me that it was so that I could rest. It would have been nice if she had simply told me that she needed a break, that she had another patient to see, or whatever the true reason for the interruption was. And the short break was fine except that Jennifer ended my procedure that day without finishing completely. I had to schedule a follow-up appointment later that week to have two sharp points that were irritating my cheek fixed.
On the up side, Jennifer did find two cavities that another dentist had missed. And she worked a lot harder than most dentists would to fill two wisdom teeth so that I didn't have to have them pulled!
Unfortunately, it was the front office staff that made the entire experience very frustrating. After my procedure her staff charged me $110 OVER THEIR ESTIMATE because, they said, that they anticipated some additional fees from my insurance company. I complied and paid the extra fees. They told me to check my insurance statement when it arrived a couple weeks later to verify the additional charges were justified. When my statement arrived there were no such charges which means that Jennifer's staff overcharged me 'just in case'. Two weeks later I called the office and her staff stated that they hadn't received this information yet and that they would get back to me when they did. They told me to wait rather than simply asking for a copy of my statement. Three weeks passed before I finally drove to their office with my statement in hand. They then stated that they had since received the insurance information but had failed to call me or simply mail a refund check to me.
This is an office run for the convenience of their staff rather than that of their clients.",0

6631058,2,"Bottom line: decent detailing with more friction than I like.

First, the place is very hard to find without guidance - I had to talk to Max to get in and still took me about 10 minutes driving before I could locate it (I understand from another review that this is being addressed).  I got there a little early, but wasn't sure how to go in or drop my keys off, so I just waited outside the garage door until they decided to open it up (and I know the employee inside saw me earlier than that - he just didn't acknowledge me).

The manager came and I explained what I was needing done. I had booked their interior and exterior detailing for a mid-size SUV (total cost $210, with the 10% off coupon for new customers meant $189). He looked at my car for less than 30 seconds and advised me that it would be $20 more because ""it looked pretty bad.""  I told him firmly that I wouldn't pay anything more than the quoted price as there was no mention of charging more for it being ""pretty bad"" on their website. He quickly backpedaled, but made sure to mention that Max had said he could charge more at his discretion.

This was 9 AM. I made the appointment so that it could be done by early afternoon (the website said it would take 4-5 hours) but the manager told me it would probably be closer to 5. To his credit, the manager was communicative all day, which was nice.

I got the car back and the detailing job was good, but being nitpicky I did notice some unclean spots on the interior and exterior.  Overall, it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst - it was only slightly above average. (For the record, I had a detailing job done for $150 that did everything Detail to the MAX did, except MAX did a better job cleaning my mats.)  I also like detailers to go over the finer details with me - take enough notice to say ""well we tried to get this stain out but couldn't"", etc. - and that didn't happen.

I probably won't return as a customer as I don't appreciate a relationships starting with ""here's how we'd like to charge you more"". There are plenty of detailing places around the area. My advice: if you do business here, don't pay anything more than what the website quotes.",0
6978078,1,"My girlfriend went to Renown urgent care (on Vista Blvd) for extreme leg swelling, chest pain, and shortness of breath. She was told she had to go to the ER.

5056712,2,"I am giving 2 stars because it is nice to order food during a movie - especially beer. My issues? 

1. You will basically be forced to pay $1.50 extra per ticket. The seating is so competitive you've got very little (no) chance of rolling in on a weekend and buying a ticket 30-45 minutes before showtime. Today I bought a ticket online 8 hours before the showtime, and there were only 3 tickets left. None of them together, so I had to convince people to slide down once I got there. I live 20 minutes away, so I've either got to do an extra 40 minutes of driving earlier that day, or eat the multiple $1.50 charges. 

2. The menu is fine, if you like mediocre burgers and pizza. If you are looking for a salad, for example you have 2 options, and one of them is a steak salad for $14. I asked if they could leave off the steak, put extra toppings on and maybe knock a few dollars off since they had no salads without meat. No go. The waitress actually said they wouldn't modify the salad because it was too ""new!"" That's just ridic. A vegetarian looking for a meat free option and they said: ""No, we will not take off the meat."" They offer no meat free salad entree...so I paid $14 to take the meat off myself. There wasn't much to the salad after removing the meat. In hindsight, I should not have bent to their game and should have just gotten an order of fries. That salad wasn't even close to being worth $14

3. We ordered food 25 mins before the movie. It finally came, an hour later, 35 mins into the movie. It took an hour to get a salad and a salad stuffed pita. At that point, the scenes were so dark and the lighting so dark, I couldn't see to even eat my salad - I kept getting air on my fork when I was trying to eat. I had no choice but to use the flashlight on my phone (turned low) to eat the salad, annoying my fellow seat mates and missing parts of the movie. I had hoped ordering a salad almost 30 mins before the movie would fly, but I would now suggest you order as soon as the theatre door opens and the waitress asks you what you want to drink. Be first! 

Overall, it is a good concept, but the food prices have gone up, the ticket prices have gone up, and the quality and service is not very good. I have never had a server or restaurant tell me I can't modify something, especially when the component is something I can't eat - that was definitely a first. Don't order here if you have allergies or special food needs. I also think they need to adjust the lighting so you can at least see a ""little"" of what is on your plate. My hubby was also using his flashlight, because he couldn't see the ketchup to dip his fries.

Then we ordered some sweets to eat later.  OH MY GOSH.....These desserts were the grosses things we ever ate.    

We ordered the coconut lime cake which was so beautiful but it was so dry it was inedible.  All you could taste from the frosting was LARD.  I never ate a frosting made from lard.  It was disgusting.  The coconut was the only thing good.

Next was the red velvet cupcake.  This thing was so mouth watering gorgeous and piled high as a kite with icing.  Icing made again from LARD. Don't they know it should be made with cream cheese?  This too went into the trash.    

The apple tart was OK....it too was very dry. 

If you are going to sell day old desserts don't charge full price.   We threw all the desserts away.  Just like throwing 14.00 down the garbage disposal.

I have probably gone there about 4 times a month for at least the  last year to pick up or dine in for lunch. Something has happened over the last several months however. The last four to go  orders I've placed have been messed up in one shape or form. Today was the last time I will be ordering  from them. I ordered their chicken roll ups to go and went and picked up my order. There  was an accident to downtown so it took me 45 mins to  get to my office just to discover they gave me tHe  wrong order, some kind of steakk sandwich and I don't eat red meat so that won't work for me. Online they offer delivery so I called to see if they  could deliver my correct order since I had taken my entire lunch order getting  there and back but they refused. The girl on the phone had attitude with me and basically saId they must've switched my order with someone else and couldn't help me. I complained to their corporate office and got a refund but i jusT don't understand why checking an order or doing it correctly is so hard. I don't have time to keep going someplace that can't get an order right.",0
1090102,2,"I went to Irwin's for the first time yesterday. We had 5pm reservations (right as it opens). The elevator opens at the 8th floor and before we can step out, a man comes into the elevator and tells us we need to go down. We can not go into the restaurant yet. Mind you we got there about 5:05p. We told the man we have reservations and he very rudely told us we still have to go back down and wait atleast 10 more minutes. Right at that moment, another woman who works there let's us off the elevator and told us that we can wait outside the restaurant instead of going down. It was so confusing and disorganized. Everyone was rude and had no explanations for what they were telling us. Anyway... we finally are let in and I do have to say, the restaurant environment is pretty cool. Great views and vibes, but honestly it doesn't look like the owner did much to ""spruce"" the place up from the old school room it once was. It definitely gave a unique feel to the room but the seating wasn't very comfortable and I wasnt impressed by the furniture. The food we ordered was good but VERY small portions. The service was great and our waitress did tell us to order multiple dishes but the dishes weren't cheap. After getting our food, I was shocked at how little food we were served for what we were paying for. It's not like the items on the menu are particularly expensive. I ordered lamb meatballs, I got three smaller than golf balls, and they were close to $15! Literally for just three small meatballs. My biggest surprise was the ""bread"" that came with the hummus. I will say it was very good naan, but a very tiny piece. They asked us several times if we wanted more because we had a lot of hummus left over, so of course we said yes. We got two more pieces. Little did we know they were charging us $8 for the extra two pieces!!! The drink prices were a little steep but what you might expect in the city, so I would recommend going there maybe for a drink sometime and to catch the view, but I would definitely not recommend going there for dinner. Absolutely not worth it. Pretty disappointed.",0

2695268,2,"Salt Shack came highly recommended by family members. We haven't been going out much since COVID so we definitely wanted to make sure our selection is taking all safely precautions and the food is worth going out for. While the location is pretty on the Bay - the Gandy Bridge in the background with loud traffic noise does detract from the water view. Both my husband and I agreed that we could easily get past the Gandy traffic noise if the food was worth it. We both ordered Skinny Margaritas and the Tuna Tartare and Fish Spread appetizer to begin. The margaritas tasted good but were very watered down. The appetizers were good. Our server was great - very attentive and wore her mask properly (thank goodness because some of the staff was simply wearing their ""chin strap"" - mask around the chin -seriously?? How does that help anyone?? Just leave it at home if you're not going to wear it properly and let the public know your staff isn't wearing masks). Some of the patrons were walking around without masks. We also both ordered sandwiches - the Grouper sandwich & Crabcake sandwich. Very disappointing. The small piece of Grouper was swallowed by the huge and not very fresh bun - we have had much better grouper sandwiches at several local restaurants which we would highly recommend. This grouper sandwich was not good. The crabcake was mushy and had the same stale and huge bun which took over the meal. The yuca fries were good though. We gave the drinks another chance and each ordered Sunburns - mostly water - was there something other than ice and water in them? Unfortunately, we will not return and do not recommend Salt Shack :(",0

I had a Groupon for a Brazilian Wax and, after multiple times of trying to make an appointment, I finally made one for 4:30 because I work until 4:00.
I use Groupon often and this was the first time I had to give the voucher # at the time of booking. Thought it was fishy at the time but, like a dummy, I gave it to her. After passing what looked like 3 homeless drug addicts in the stairwells I finally found Videll's (the unit # on her website was incorrect so I was all of 8 minutes late). Walked into what looked like a low class whore house only to be told my appointment was at 4:00 and I would have to pay a rescheduling fee of $30...just about the price of my Groupon that she had already processed. Gee, what a coincidence!!! Although I was totally ripped off I actually feel that I lucked out after reading these other reviews.

5969129,1,"I travel a lot on business and always rent from Avis. I have rented from Avis from Boston to San Francisco, from many small small towns like Chattanooga, Sidney NE, etc. I have never felt compelled to comment on Avis because I have always come to expect great consistent service no matter where I go. Well never until now. Avis PHL is the lone exception. I have rented from Avis PHL twice now. Both times, the return process was so broken that both times, I had to wait (stuck) on Arrival Road. That is right, I was stuck waiting for a long line of returning cars that stretched outside the rental gate to the airport roadway. The first time, I thought it must have been a system glitch. After mentioning this to my friends who rent from this Avis, it seems to be the norm. So I guess I wasn't surprised when I got stuck for about 20 minutes before I finally snaked in and somebody got around to giving me my receipt. Sheesh, don't they realize that road warriors sometimes have to push the envelope in getting to the airport because of late meetings and don't have much time safety buffer. The last thing a renter needs is huge frustration or stress in the car rental process. In all other Avis locations, I would simply have driven up to the return lane, wait at most a minute before somebody would come up and give me a receipt. 

The other thing to watch out for is taking the shuttle to the terminals. The first time I took it, I was stuck on the shuttle because the traffic was really heavy on the airport roadways. This time, I just walked across the street and across the short term parking to the terminal. 

All in all, I am not impressed with Avis PHL.",0

3298150,1,"Horrible horrible place! My hair is still recovering from this place. I wouldn't have written this review but the damage was done and my hair just hasn't been the same since. :( I wanted to share my story on here.

I used to go to chatters before I found a specific hairdresser in Edmonton that I liked. I really needed to get my roots done and didn't know where else to go so I made an appt at chatters for a colour and tone. My hair at the time was blonde and my roots are red, so I needed a colour and tone. 

I got there and the hair dresser was nice at first. I told her that I bleach my hair white blonde, and that I needed my roots done and an overall tone. She seemed fine with that and started mixing colour. When she began applying it, I noticed that she was colouring the majority of my hair, not just the roots, but I figured that she knew what she was doing. It's so horribly awkward to question people at the salon so I just didn't. Anyway, she basically let me process for over an hour under the heat lamp. I told her I usually don't need to process this long for a root touch up, but she said it was fine... What came out was my completely white bleached roots and NEON ORANGE hair. I have no idea what happened, but another stylist told me my hair was over processed or something. I should have stopped her, but my stylist insisted she knew what she was doing!

When I got back to the chair I was so upset, and my stylist just made it worse. She told me it was my fault because she didn't know that my hair was naturally red, which makes NO SENSE because I clearly told her that all I wanted was a root touch-up and a tone. At the start of the appointment, I said ""I bleach my hair blonde"", not sure how much clearer I needed to be. I told her that it's not my fault that she didn't listen at the beginning and that she was nuts if she thought that white blonde with HUGE red roots was my natural hair colour. I then told her that she was being extremely rude, and she began to apologize and tried to fix my hair. I ended up leaving with this orangy mess of a haircut, so embarrassing. 

I went to another salon and met the woman who does my hair now, she basically told me that it wasn't worth the damage to keep my hair blonde. I waited two days before going back to a salon for a fix, and my hair was falling out in the shower and completely FRIED. So I ended up having to do something called a shampoo cocktail, a deep condition, and then finally at the end we decided to dye it brown and cut off all the fried ends.

So in sum, my blonde hair was completely ruined here. It's been a while since then, and my hair has never been the same. I used to have such nice thick long hair and now I have thin, damaged, short hair. I will NEVER go back to this place under any circumstances.

On a customer service note - I feel like I was treated very poorly. I was never greeted by the receptionist, I had to wander around to find someone to check me in. And when my hair was messed up, the stylist was not sympathetic for her screw up.",0

5855406,1,"What people say about the wait is totally true; we trotted in on a Sunday morning, and were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant. Everything was going quite well, until we were not waited (not even a drink order) on for 25-30 minutes... pretty bad when waiters are just passing by without care.

I am wondering what the waiters are doing this whole time; other people seat you, bring out your food, and clean up your table... what else do these people have to do?  I hardly saw any of them out on the floor the entire time we waited.

Anyway, after two other tables were seated, we asked one of the waiters that was evidentially not ours to snag our waiter.  In the meantime, another table was seated right next to us, and was waited on immediately.

We took our business elsewhere at this point.  If you are going to seat someone, you need to at least acknowledge their existence before a half hour has elapsed.  I was giving this place a little leeway because of the expectations coming in... and I hate to be one of those ""one-star"" people when everyone else seems to be giving it good reviews.

I would have liked to try the food, the food that everyone was getting around us looked quite good.

34253,1,"DO NOT BOOK YOUR WEDDING BLOCK HERE!!! Leading up to the event, there was so much turn around in the management office that my information was regularly confused, guests were not tracked properly, and I had to send multiple emails before receiving a response. When we got to the hotel the day before the wedding, they had lost a package that contained gifts for my gift bags even though the carrier had a signature from their staff indicating they had signed for it! Worst of all, I had asked the hotel to charge our parents' rooms to our account and filled out the paperwork they required me to fill out weeks beforehand. Not only did they not notify our parents that their rooms had been taken care of, they charged their credit cards and ours!!! My parents had no idea that I had paid for their suite! When I emailed my complaints to the hotel, I received an email back from a manager-in-training (she literally signed her email that way) saying she was sorry and that she hopes I return to the hotel so they could make it up to me. I then called the Hotel and was told upper management would call me on Monday (they were not available on the weekends). That was three weeks ago and I still have not received a phone call. 

Additionally, the hotel charged up for everything! They charged $4 per gift bag, would have charged a $1,000 minimum for less than an hour of after party food and drinks, and charged $35 a person for a bagels and fruit breakfast. 

The Hotel Omni Hotel, on the other hand, was effortless. I had the same contact there for the year and he was great! They didn't charge me anything to deliver gift bags, kept the bar open for us on the wedding night with no minimum, and people raved about the rooms and the service. I really wish I had booked all of my rooms there. 

I really hope no other bride has to go through what I did. It was the ONLY thing that made me stressed the entire weekend and was the only vendor that I would not recommend. I could not have been more disappointed in the service at the Hotel Monaco. 

UPDATE: The day after I posted the review, I was contacted by a very nice woman from management.  She let me know they they had just hired someone to manage room blocks and gave me a refund on my gift bag charges.

Told her the food was burnt she said she'll check to see if we could get another order the manager said no because we ate most of it. In a nutshell first and last time we will go there.,0

While the pizza is very good, the poor management and unfriendly staff is just frustrating!  We have ordered to go and eaten in and every time they either screw up our order, or 'we forgot to make your pizza'!!!

Last night we walked over for a quite pizza and beer.  It took them FIFTY MINUTES to get our one large pizza to us!!

Last time we had their pizza, we figured we would by pass the annoying staff and ordered to go.  Told 20 minutes, got there 15 minutes later and NO PIZZA even started!  Lost that phone order too!!

In our humble opinion .... JUST NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!!",0
5576712,1,"I attended a private party at Tavola on August 30th, 2021. The only food that we enjoyed was the short rib entree, the ravioli appetizer, the cheesesteak egg rolls and the bruschetta. Unfortunately all the other entrees, including shrimp linguini, salmon, and chicken parmesan, as well as the Caesar salad were really disappointing in terms of preparation and cost ($75/person). We brought our own cake because it was a birthday and they said there was a $3 charge to cut our cake. We were supposed to have outdoor seating for our party of nine, but we were seated in a private indoor room instead. In a community which is primarily white it felt as though we were being hidden away in a back room because we are Black. Our server told us that we could get up to go the bar for our drinks. The bartender service was impersonal and discourteous. Overall, the experience was exclusionary and the food was not worth the price.",0

3900730,1,"This review is for the food and service/management response alone. The beer selection is awesome! 

I want to like this place so much, but I'm so sick of constantly being disappointed. I NEVER write reviews. Ever. But after 5 times of our sandwiches being wrong, and getting no response from management I want to write this review. 

There is one guy that works making the sandwiches that is horrible at his job. He has never gotten any of our orders correct, and if you question him about making sure everything is on the sandwich or if it's toasted or whatever, he's extremely rude and says it's right and walks away. After the 4th time he messed up our food I called the store to talk to a manager. No manager was present, and the girl that answered told me he constantly messes up, and that he even messes up her food and that they are always getting complaints about him. If he's so terrible at his job, why is he still working there?!? Management was supposed to call me back the following day but never did. 

Last week my mom was visiting and decided to pick up sandwiches from there and bring them back to my house. I wasn't there to see who made the sandwiches (she said it was a male with dark hair) but both were wrong, again. I decided to write them an email instead of writing a review on Facebook or anything bc I noticed they don't really respond to their negative reviews anymore (all of which are about sandwiches being wrong), and so far I haven't gotten a response. I'm not looking for free food or anything like that, but something needs to be done about this guy. I obviously don't think he should be fired, but don't have him make the food. They clearly have a management problem, which is really a shame because this place could be so great. Also, my boyfriend and I have worked in the food and craft beer industry off and on for 15+ years, from dishwasher to management and everything in between so we are usually pretty flexible and understanding about mistakes. But it's just ridiculous at this point, and it's awful that management won't even address customer complaints.",0

1739253,1,"I never have the motivation to write yelp reviews, but Royal House was so bad, that I felt it was my duty to help people avoid it. This is the textbook definition of a tourist trap.
You might see nearly 4,000 reviews on yelp and a 4 star rating, but that does not tell the full story. 

For the appetizer we ordered the oyster duo. It took 2 minutes for it to come out of the kitchen, and it sure looked like they only spent that long making it. The oysters were dry and definitely not fresh. I've never seen such a gross looking ""Rockefeller Oyster."" There was no cheese or bacon on it, like what a typical Rockefeller Oyster has. We've tried oysters from several other places in New Orleans and the difference in taste is truly outstanding. So that's $14 down the drain.

For the entree, I ordered a Shrimp Poboy that tasted like frozen shrimp with stale bread. The fries were cold as well. My girlfriend ordered the house burger and I've never seen a burger be butchered so badly. She ordered it medium well with bacon (additional $2). Instead she got a soggy bun with a rare patty and no bacon. The cheese was not melted and there was no lettuce. Which typically come with a cheeseburger. 

The best part about this place is that the food came out so fast; I didn't have to wait to be disappointed. Avoid Royal House at all costs.",0

I bought one of the Living Social deals for this restaurant and finally used it with a friend.  We were acknowledged at the door by a bartender who did not welcome us. 
We ordered right away since we had viewed the menu earlier.  It took over 40 minutes to get two soggy hamburgers with cold, generic crinkle cut fries (which were Extra!).

During the 40 minute wait for mediocre burgers a 4 man band was trying to set up in a tiny space about 4 feet from our tiny table. The restaurant diners were treated to screeching feedback.    When our burgers arrived we were ready to leave.

The best part is the bill -  It came out to LESS than the coupon value by three dollars. The waitress told us she would have to run a charge of 1.00 so it would come up on the register!!

First off we didn't even order close to the same meal but after getting our check I noticed she did put it in as the same thing. The bacon was burnt on one side to the point it was black and disgusting and the other side looked raw almost like the cook never flipped it.

The OJ was also kind of bitter, and even with sugar added it was still a little hard to drink.

Pros:  Nice theater & clean in general including women's bathroom, pleasant staff.
Cons:  Oh. So. Many.  The reclining seats are very inferior to the ones at the Cobb Tyrone theater - not as soft or wide and no power recline.  I can understand some people not having the body strength to project their body weight in the right places to make the seats re/decline - perhaps that's why several were broken per the reservation screen upon choosing my seat.  The lighting in the corner seats pre-movie is very dark - I had to use my phone light to read the food/drink menu.  SMG sells Pepsi products; they were out of Diet Dr. Pepper which seems to be a common thread per some other reviews.  Other than the bar in the lobby, all food/drinks must be ordered from servers within the theater.  I assume they expect a tip but unsure since I didn't order anything.  The menu items looked good but typical high prices for movie food.  I noticed they sell a fried fish entree - who wants to smell fried movie theater fish in a movie theater??  The worst thing about the ordering experience is being unable to get on top of my fake-butter game for popcorn - if I'm going to get popcorn, I want to control the copious amounts of fake-butter I pour onto my popcorn.

(I'm exaggerating a bit for dramatic effect, but please believe me when I say the line was twice as long as the counter. On both visits.) Now, it's 2019: one shouldn't have to be at the USPS office twice in one week. But alas, there I am, waiting patiently, reading my book while waiting for the very long line to progress. On my first visit, there was a young mother with a fussy baby waiting behind me in line. First, let me say that not one of the many people in front of me offered to let her go ahead and be done quicker so that she and baby could go back to their lives. When I approached her and offered to take a place in front of me, she threw a quick, dismissing (fearful?) glance at the crowd behind us and politely refused. The second time, there were a couple of people (in a looong line of us) who dared express their discontent to the clerk helping them - I was taken aback at the response received from the post office staff. That response was the opposite of helpful. The opposite of polite. It lacked humility. It lacked humanity - the clerk seemed aggressive, abusive and angry at the customers voicing their malcontent! On both occasions, service was extremely slow. The post office employees (there were different ones on both visits) were sweet and patient as long as the customer stayed mum on the long lines, their performance or the fact that they were grossly understaffed. Any perceived criticism was met with grunts, groans, a loud, rude belittling of the weary customer. On both visits, I have spent (wasted?) precious time (upwards of 2 hours!) simply because the location is under staffed. Based on the reviews left here it seems like they lack the resources to make a change. A pity, as it could run so effectively if they simply put more staff out on days they experience heavy traffic.

It was definitely fish bc I don't eat land animals but obviously if I can't even remember then it wasn't that good. I know my husband tried some form of meat and he was highly unimpressed and said I could've made it better. It was disappointing bc Emeril is this famous chef and you would just expect that anything you order is gonna knock your socks off and it didn't by a long shot. We both left very disappointed each time but when you're hungry and you know better sometimes the hunger pains get in the way of judgment. I would not give this place a 3rd try.",0
4475940,2,"The only reason I'm giving this theater 2 stars today is because the seating is awesome and it's has been my favorite theater.  I'm watching Captain America right now and doing a slow burn.

The $8.00 popcorn is chewy and over salted and our $5 water bottles are warm.  WTF?  It took 10 min and a call to a manager for two cashiers to locate the water bottles.  Maybe that manager should be making sure that the concession stand is fully stocked and the popcorn is fresh and doesn't taste like a stick of salt.  My lips are actually burning from the salt. For the prices charged, I don't think that's too much to ask.",0
2589625,1,"Very RUDE owner, I don't know how this guy is still in business!

My 4 year old daughter got sick in the car, so we pulled in to get her cleaned up and refuel the truck. My wife and daughter went into the bathroom. the bathroom was so dirty she had to put down four paper towels to stand our daughter on and two to set her bag down, and a few to dry their hands and face. For the few min they were in there the owner was trying to open the door. When she opened the door the man was standing in her face yelling   "" I cant believe you, you so rude, you use all my paper towels, you owe me money!  and  your husband use my paper towels at pump, those expensive you pay me!! "" ( I used 5 - 8 individual paper towels by the way )

My wife came out and informed me what just happened, I went inside and had a discussion with the man and gave him some money for his ""very expensive"" paper towels, and informed him that I was going to fuel my truck, and buy some cleaning supplies for the mess elsewhere. SHELL just lost our families business for life.

What kind of person yells at a mother and 4 year old child (a customer!) over some paper towels??  This man should not be in this business!!",0

We ordered a few drinks, took the waiter forever to get them. Once we did they were warm and not great. We ordered the shrimp appetizer, also seemed like it sat too long - came out to us warm,  not hot. For dinner he ordered snapper, which had little no flavor or seasoning - just eh. I ordered filet mignon, it was okay at best. Not much flavor, overcooked. Nothing special at all. The zucchini corn side was tasty, other than that - not overly impressed with food or service. Sorry Devon, we'll try elsewhere next time!",0
6880846,2,"The meatball SANDWICH is delicious! But literally getting yelled at and pretty much being called a liar..that is unacceptable!
Ordered by phone, and after I asked for the 12 inch meatball sandwich, he asked if I wanted the pizza or sandwich.  I said ""Sandwich"" . (Rarely eat pizza)
Go inside to pick up, and they rang up a pizza, which they now referred to ask ""Pie""
I explained that I wanted a sandwich, so the cashier tells the guy that took my order. He comes to the counter and yells at me that I said pizza!  He said he specifically asked..I agreed he asked..but I said sandwich!!
This went on for awhile as he went back to make a sandwich and still yelling that it was my mistake, etc.
I even asked if he was calling me a liar, and he refused to let it go. I have never been yelled at in any type of business before!
I e-mailed the owner and waited over a month, still no response!!!  Too bad!",0

1702934,1,"Horrible. Just before staying here for 4 or so days, I spent a couple of nights at the Getaway Hostel in Chicago, a lovely little place that's clean, welcoming, and professional. Maybe that spoiled this hostel for me.

The room was filthy. A maid came at 8 am on my second day and loudly woke us up with the vacuum but appeared to clean nothing else. I was afraid to touch anything in the disgusting showers. Everything smelled like mold. The kitchen looked like it belonged in a prison and someone continuously stole people's food out of the fridge. It was nearly impossible to track down someone who worked there and when you did, they had absolutely no interest in helping in any way.

Also, the picture at the top of this page is of the nicer building across the street, not the set of dilapidated shacks that make up the hostel.",0

One poor newborn puppy was shaking for the entire time we were there and was struggling to stand. Another puppy was barking for food. The bearded dragons' nails desperately needed to be clipped and the snakes seemed depressed. 

Aside from the animal abuse, the store itself was also very overwhelming. The lights were way too bright and the sections were disorganized. Additionally, in the midst of a pandemic, none of the employees were wearing masks nor were they encouraging customers to maintain six foot distance. Very disappointing.",0

It never arrived.  FTD attempted to contact the florist but they did not answer the phone so they ordered a second redelivery. Again, it never arrived. A third redelivery request resulted the same non-delivery.  I was finally able to reach a supervisor with FTD who was eventually able to contact this florist. Bottom line, this florist REFUSED to do a redelivery of my order.  FTD did refund my purchase price and will be looking into finding a different florist to service the 89521 zip code.

He moved it up at one point, but when he needed to talk to the other employee, he took his mask down. The opposite of what you are supposed to do and not what I wanted to see.

Regular donuts are $1. Special donuts are about 10 cents more. Very very inexpensive place to get donuts and coffee or milk.

I have been there another time as well about three years ago and one of the best meals of my life. I was so excited to work again in New Orleans as it would give me an opportunity to make reservations for my business colleague and I for last night.  I had been talking up NOLA for days and then we arrived for our reservation.  We were seated upstairs and first the wrong drinks came to us and then the wrong appetizer... it took about 10 minutes for our waiter to come to our table and even acknowledge us. We ordered for appetizers frog legs, chicken skin nachos and the foot-long eggroll. The eggroll was nothing to speak of as it honestly tasted like any eggroll I've ever had. The mushrooms that came with the dish have the strangest and fake smoke flavoring to them.  That flavored haunted me the rest of the evening. The chicken nachos were uncreative, however, the frog legs were good. My friend and colleague ordered shrimp and grits and I ordered the garlic encrusted drum fish. The shrimp and grits also had that fake, strange smoke to it and the shrimp was small and tasteless. The fish was not at all like I remembered. The potatoes and green beans underneath the fish was the best part of the dish. We didn't even stay for dessert because the service was so poor and the food so very average. I'm so very disappointed and embarrassed as I talked this restaurant up for weeks!!  Emeril should be embarrassed! I would never recommend it to anyone.",0

By the end of the night we ended in the ER because my sons had a anaphylactic reaction  from the seasonings Zeak puts on their crab. The next day I called to figure out what exactly is in the seasoning - one of the employees told me ""oh, we don't  know and have no way to find out"" this is because the seasonings are pre-made by a supplier in another state. Um, ok? there are tons of people with food allergies and you don't know what's being put in the seasonings you are selling to the public? liability much? 

I called again the next day to speak to a manager. How can a company serve food but don't know whats in the food they are selling! I spoke to a manager (woman) she said she would find out and call me back - she didn't. I called back yet again a couple days later and some employee gave me some bogus answer of - salt pepper, Paprika and ""other spices"" but he doesn't know what the ""other spices"" entail -  I'll stick to Captains Catch!

What will forever stand out for me about this place was the atrociously over-fried grouper.

Shame on me for not sending it back. Whatever they did, it didn't work at all. Had some lobster/tomato bisque that had mostly tomato flavoring and not much else, feh. The overall food experience was so bad that it will be a laughing joke for me each time I drive by there.

Upon arriving to the bar on New Years Eve the bouncers and manager of the bar told us that it was never that price and that it is $20 at the door instead. Once showing the manager the advertisement they had on their companies website she informed us there was nothing she could do. False advertising and poor managerial skills on her part. Once arriving into the bar they informed us we had to pay $60 for a table, however she would give us only $20 off. Again, although she tried giving us something, very inconsistent and poor service all around from staff and managers of the bar. We will not be returning.

811189,2,"Since going here for almost two years now, basically nothing has changed. The equipment is still outdated and faded, the customers are still mostly normal people with a few bros in tanks walking around, and the staff (and therefore rules) are still non-existent at best. It's convenient, and that's about it.

I honestly wish they would just throw in the towel and let better management in to spiffy up the place and give it some actual lifeblood. As of right now, it's basically just a warehouse with equipment and a receptionist.

[UPDATE]

Since writing this review, the owner of CH&F has contacted me asking for feedback. He was open to listening to what I had to say and I appreciate this a lot from a business owner. I am hoping to see some positive changes in the coming months, at which point I'll post another update (hopefully better this time).",0

Not that I expect that same treatment every time, but the past few months management in this restaurant have changed for the worse. Every single time I've come in the past summer months there's been a lack of concern about customer service and food quality overall.

The check engine light was also on so we knew we needed to get that checked and cleared up. $500 later the check engine light is still on, even though they had the car for a week. We were told some line about driving it for 150 miles to see if the light would go out, which of course it didn't. We were also told at that time that they would call us in a few days to follow up, which never happened.  I'm not even sure what the extra $500 we paid was for, since they couldn't get the check engine light to go off, even after they had the car for a whole week, and we did the likely bulls**t recommendation of driving it for 150 miles. Went in after the 150 mile mark and wasn't able to talk to Shane who had originally worked on the car. The person we spoke to this time washed his hands of the whole thing, and even had the nerve to ask why we had left the garage with the check engine light on in the first place. They finally said they would give us a 25% discount if we wanted to bring it back for them to keep looking.  No resolution on the issue. Really disappointed. We have one of those check engine light code readers, and our bill had something on that that didn't show up on the original code reader, and then didn't show up when we asked them to verify it when we picked the car up. In my opinion that means they overcharged us for something that wasn't a problem.",0

They tell me its because of the fuel pump, so i go ahead and get that done, which is over $800 job. Then they call and tell me, that wasn't it and it was a engine module. Now i had to pay for that as well, on top of this fuel pump i never needed. Of course like any other shop they also give you a whole list of all the things wrong with your car. So with getting some work done, I end up paying close to $2300. Two days later my mom's engine light comes on again. Now I have to come off of work and get her car looked at before the weekend. Now they tell me its something on the engine that i had replaced twice already this year. Although i don't believe it was that i think they looked for something to blame it on so sure why not blame it on an aftermarket piece. Long story short. I ended up paying close to $3000 here in a week time. Totally feel taken advantage of and duked. I hope I never have to use this location again.",0

For the rest of you out there, this update is to say never get your hopes up if you see a posting from HD like the one they made below.  I sent them the information and receipt they requested and all they did was sent a canned reply with the same info I already knew.  Many companies will make good on their mistake.  HD won't.  But I am happy to report that so far they have lost $13,700 in sales during our home improvements to a competitor because we won't go back there ever again because they did not make good on their error.  Shop somewhere else.

---------------------------------
Original Post:

We recently moved into this area and with a new home, we wanted to add a lot of things.

The wife sends me off to purchase about $1400 worth of home items.  I was going to go to Lowe's because they sent us an email 10% moving coupon.  The wife called Home Depot because it was closer and asked if they would accept the competitive coupon and they said yes.  No problem on the amount of things we buy.

I go to HD and just to make sure the wife wasn't confused, I showed them the coupon at the register BEFORE I started shopping and they confirmed they would accept it.  So I spend 2 hours in the store gathering all the items on our list and checked out.

At checkout time, the cashier says no problem accepting the coupon and calls over another associate to help her enter the coupon into the sale.  Then the little Asian lady says they can only honor $50 !!!.  Hmmmm, I was expecting 10% on the $1350 order so in my mind, I am cheated out of about $85 because they mislead us TWICE before checking out.  If I had known this, I would have just gone to Lowe's and gotten the same items for about the same price and saved another $85 just to travel 10 minutes.

After shopping for 2 hours, I wasn't about to waste more time leaving items behind and going to Lowe's.  We will just chaulk it up to being cheated on a bait and switch (likely due to poor cashier training) and never go there again no matter what we need.  It left a bad experience that they aren't going to correct.

They had poor training and wrong advice before the sale,  HD will just lose thousands of dollars in sales for as long as we live here and continue to dress up our home.",0
1567585,2,"I have been to these elsewhere, and this is about the worst set up for Dialing Piano - that will still work.   Meaning; if you go you may still have fun, but...

The layout is a typical rowhome, so the whole place is like 30 feet wide, add a bar and stairway entrance in the middle, and then less then 1/3 of the place can see the entertainment.  In the back, where 2/3 of the people are, there is ONE LOUD speaker.  So you face one way toward the pianos, and get blasted by sound from behind.
And then there is the sound. I literally felt bad for the pianos.  Granted this is very much a ""party"" thing, and you do not go for the sound quality.  But the way they beat on the keys, just resulted in noise.  
The singers were entertaining, and knew the shtick, but really could not sing, they each had a range of about 6 notes - imagine listening to a journey song sung with 6 notes...  if you call this serenaded, you really need to get out more.

5362446,1,"I came once with my husband on a Saturday a month ago and we had a quick, easy meal & planned on coming back. We brought our 2 kids & parents on a Sunday- only 1 other table before us waiting on food. It took almost an hour by the time all was said & done. My father's omelet was done, but another omelet was given to us that we didn't order. I had to ask for mine to be re-made. It took another 20 minutes to get the next plates....a somewhat burnt kids pancake & another omelet & an egg sandwich that was missing the meat ordered. The potatoes were completely unseasoned & hard. We were still completely missing a kids egg sandwich & they seemed unaware that we were missing both the re-made omelet & egg sandwich so we had to ask for both. What came out was an adults eggs sandwich missing the side of sweet potatoes & finally my omelet which had a fried burnt pile of something in it, like the scraps from the grill & no seasoning whatsoever. The total for this horrid experience was $92. Yes, $92 because we had 3 mimosas too. The girl working the front did come over to ask how it was & I was honest with her. She offered up 2 handwritten notes for 50% off the next meal but sadly I don't think we'll risk coming back.",0
2288568,2,"In the past when I heard ""pie hole,"" the first thing to come to mind was Ned's Bakery on Pushing Daisies.  That's still the first thing, but now the second thought is this downtown pizza joint.

We gave it a try this past Labor Day.  Normally I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza, but theirs is very yummy if overly greasy.   We also tried  the cheesy garlic bread, which is very generously portioned.  In fact, prices were very reasonable overall.

However, a few things put me off. 

First, it's small inside which is fine but placing an arcade game right next to the counter doesn't really help with congestion.  

Second, they were blasting really crass music in the middle of the afternoon.  Even most bars play it safer than that.  I was a little embarrassed on behalf of the family that came in while we were placing our order.   It just wasn't very mindful of the kind of customers that pop in during the afternoon.  We have music at home that we would never put on for mixed company.  It's just common sense.  Maybe they are trying to discourage a particular clientele (pretty much everyone?)

And finally, the service was iffy at best.  One person at the counter was almost as abrasive as the music.  As much as I like the pizza here and at the similarly sketchy Flying Pie, I'm not sure I want to continue rewarding their bad service with my patronage. 

We did enjoy people watching on the patio while we ate, but between the service and the horrible tummy ache that followed, I'm not sure if we'll be back.",0

The problem is that they do not seem to value the time of their customers. Today I had an appointment for something that would take about 30 minutes. I had a very busy schedule, which is why I made the appointment (I didn't have tons of time to just sit around waiting). Ten minutes past my appointment time, I asked when I would be seen and was told it would be another 15 minutes. So despite having an appointment, I would have to wait 25 minutes for my 30 minute manicure. Had I known they could not see me at my appointment time (or within 10 minutes or so; I know things happen), I would have made an appointment somewhere else. Instead, I am not able to get my service because 70 Nails took an appointment they could not keep.

Unfortunately after waiting over 45 min for our food with very poor customer service this place was a big disappointment.  I understand good food takes time to cook but the French Toast was soggy  and the eggs were made with so much grease they were hard to get down.

Well, that affirmed my guests opinion of the tuna and it got under my skin. He new the fish he sold me was not good quality but didn't even consider compensating me at all.
I did not ask for a refund or a discount but felt it was his responsibility to stand by his product.

Just walked up and took it. I had the filet and my boyfriend had the porter house. Both were good. The horse radish garnish was weak. At the end of our meal I told the waiter that it was my boyfriend's birthday and he brought over a little cake. That cake was not edible.

The gym is clean and not overcrowded.  I started with membership that includes guest privileges.  With only 3 months left of the contract, I was told that they terminated guest privilege memberships and just downgraded my membership with a lower monthly fee.  I expected the contract to be honor - but sure, I didn't mind the change all that much.  I had a guest with me at the time this was announced, and paid the one-time fee.  My guest was interested in becoming a monthly member, but the staff that helped us was very pushy on the annual membership.  Yes we are aware of the slightly higher price tag for the month-to-month membership, but not everyone can commit to one location for a full year.

The difference was NEVER compensated.  Not only that, I was billed even after my membership had ended.  I called in, a staff answered and confirmed that I had properly cancelled my membership, she apologized and said that the error is due to some changes in billing services.

2757260,2,"First off, let me start with my order, I ordered a pizza and few other items, this is my first time ordering from this place. So delivery shows up to the house, has everything but my pizza. So I call and they assure me he will pick it up and bring it back, ll the while saying it will be hot, the staff there says we use pizza hot bags your order will be hot, fast forward,  driver shows up no pizza hot bag, pizza is not hot, and top it all off ,when he first showed up with just everything but pizza ,driver goes to car and leaves, takes my other hot stuff with him, I finally get everything to my house. U guessed it, not hot, I tried call to rectify it, no help. By the way , pizza was not good, and fries were saturated with grease, the salad I received for almost 9 bucks had no lettuce in it. I am truly disappointed in this establishment, quality control goes a long way, starts at the top.  I know people make mistakes,  I can look past alot , but when your charging me almost 50 bucks for food, and I chose your establishment, instead of going out, this is the slop you give me,  I will NOT be ordering from here anymore.

Well, yes I am. The pizza. That's this place's biggest redeeming quality and it's not because the pizza is especially good (it's good but not great, and they always seem to be out of one or two of the toppings on the menu) but because everything else is usually fairly disappointing.

I wouldn't say anything here is every especially bad, either. It's just meh. The entire experience is almost always best described as 'meh,' which is exactly how yelp describes the 2 star rating. It's your basic pasta dishes, nothing special, not even really better than you can make at home if you know what you're doing. 

Maybe this place isn't so bad, and I've just been overexposed, but if you're looking for italian I wouldn't suggest it. Then again I wouldn't try to hard to talk you out of it either. It's just 'meh.'",0

1327150,2,"I have been to the Lawrence location before, and that was a great experience, so this is not all Camp Bow Wows. 
I called this location yesterday afternoon, and asked getting my pup in for daycare for the following day. The lady told me to come in, bring my vaccinations, told me there will be an interview, and in total this should take 15-20 mins, etc. So I go in at 7am (when they open), and the girl at the front desk did not seem too pleased. ""I wish they wouldn't have told you that.."" is what she told me. I don't get a spring break, so I don't know when spring break falls in the year, therefore I don't know how busy you are. I am just coming in at a time your coworker asked me to. I also get that your staff didn't communicate with you that there will be a new camper. But that isn't my fault. She gave me paperwork, I filled it out, and waited..and waited, until 7:50 to be helped (I had to be at work at 8). At 7:50 my dog went in for a two minute interview and she was accepted. I understand it's early, and you guys just opened, but 10 dogs shouldn't have checked in before mine. 

When I went in to pick her up at 4, I was waiting for a staff member, a lady shortly walks in after me. I'm standing at the desk and she is still at the door. When a staff member finally comes up, he waits on her. I am standing at your desk, she is at the door, and you wait on her first? After he helps her, he then looks up at me and says, ""And who are you?"" Not a...""Hey, how are you? Who are you picking up today?"" His excuse was...""When you start coming more often I'll get to know you. I didn't recognize you because you've never been here."" I know I'm new, but I would expect you to treat me like you treat your ""regulars""...not that they were treated great either but definitely a lot better than I was. So for someone who has never been there, is that how you treat new customers now? 

Webcams were great, it was nice for the dogs to have an hour or two to get some rest before they played again. My babe was exhausted when she got home so that was definitely great. 

Horrible customer experience for a new camper. Will never go to this location again.",0

1779817,1,"This may come as a surprise to some of you but I can be a real jerk sometimes. I try to keep it in check, but occasionally  people, like our initial waiter last night, bring it out of me. We rolled in last (Friday) night at 10 after 8pm. and were greeted with an eye-roll glance at the clock, a loud exhale, and an adjusting of his pants! Who does that? My girlfriend and I both instantly thought of Chris H's comments about the food being great and the service sucking and figured we had just experienced the suck, now bring on the good food...it never came. 

Our burnout took us to our table then walked away. He returned a few minutes later, pointed at our bottle of wine and grunted, ""You want me to open that?"" Uhhhh yeah. Thanks for the favor, please don't put yourself out. Strike two!

After bringing the bottle and two glasses (no wine bucket, we had to ask our next waiter for that...) burnout stomps off for a few, no mention of specials, nothing about the menu, just turns and walks away. Strike three comes when he returns, and starts SLAPPING HIS NOTE PAD IN HIS HANDS LIKE HURRY UP!! OK buddy, you want us to hurry up, how about I ask you every stupid question I can think of to keep you at the table! My satisfaction came when after a barrage of silly questions this no talent ass-clown gave us up to the younger waiter! 

In this economy, with an hour to go before the kitchen closes, don't be rude to the people that are choosing you over every other place in town. I am sure the two other tables that came in after us didn't appreciate your behavior either. 

So there is the suck, how about the food? It was just ok, but we both agreed we'd had much better else where. Mix in the attitude and you have a 1 star review.

1887600,1,"Had a very disappointing experience at Wills Eye Emergency Room.  Went to minute clinic because my upper eyelid and below my eye were swollen and I though possibly Pink Eye/Congunctivitis.  Nurse Practiioner suggested I go to an ER, she did not think it conjunctivitis, but too swollen for a minute clinic.  I figured I'd go to Wills Eye it shouldn't be a long wait.  The wait was not long however the treatment and diagnosis were wrong.  I was seen by a young resident and then a young attending. Both of whom said ""viral Congecntivitis"" go home put hot and cold compresses, nothing more they could do.  Next morning, entire side of my face swollen and both eyelids so swollen it was just about able to see out of the eye.  Friends and neighbors in Healthcare field upon seeing me, said go back because something more going on. 

Once back at ER they remembered me.  Nurses were very nice, however attending and different resident seemed annoyed that I was back. ""why are you back with in 24hrs"" was the doctor's first questions.  I said obviously I'm much more swollen and compresses doing nothing. Doctors response ""well it's going to get worse before it gets better but I'll take a look. "" After looking  said ""the eye is quite and that's not like Pink Eye but I still think that is what it is.""  I couldn't  taking that answer asked to be tested for Staph or Strep, doctor didn't want to do any of those tests but offered that she could have her supervisor come in, I guess to appease what she thought was a hypochondriac patient.   This doctor (4th one to see me) saw there were vesicles(small bumps) on my cheek and began to think it was Shingles (which it ended up being). However they didn't declare it and suggested I see my own eye doctor but had to be within 48 hrs. Did prescribe a anit-biotic but that is not the medication you would prescribe for Shingles.

Overall, doctors were dismissive, incorrect in their diagnosis, exam rooms were dirty (used tissues laying by trash cans, stains from liquids on the floor and walls near the trash cans) . Perhaps Wills Eye is cutting edge in other areas, I can only speak to my ER experience which was abysmal.  Luckily my own eye doctor very knowledgable and thorough, got to the bottom of it right away, started me on appropriate meds. Thought going to an Eye ER was the best thing I could have done at the time but was the worst. It delayed my treatment by 2 days and there is a 72 hr window when you should get treatment for Shingles.",0

The girl behind the counter was grumpy but I can't really blame her. She also suggested we try the deep dish next time and we probably should have listened.
The pan pizza is still ridiculously thick but only in terms of bread. The ratio of sauce to bread was way off, but the sauce had that tinned tomato taste anyways, so I wouldn't have wanted more. The crust was doughy and chewy in an unpleasant way. We ordered pepperoni, black olive, green pepper and there were not many pepperoni and the green pepper didn't even seem to be cooked.

This resort was my Christmas gift to my Caramel, and I could have sworn I saw a picture of a huge fire pit with people roasting marshmallows.  That was the whole reason we came here that night.  

Alas, we were informed that there is no roasting of marshmallows over their fake fire pit.  Crap!  Rather than storming off in a huff, we claimed two of the super comfy fireside chairs and enjoyed the relaxing ambiance.  

Not long after settling in, a server came along to see if we needed anything.  Really sweet girl.  She offered waters while we looked over the menu, and brought them right out.  We decided to stick to drinks while we relaxed, and I went for the Osprey Apple, while my Gorgeous ordered the Island Mango Punch.  

It took quite a while for the drinks to get to us (close to 30 minutes), but we were in no hurry.  Had we been hungry or thirsty, it would have gotten real ugly real fast.  For our two drinks and nothing else the bill was $26 and change.  The Osprey Apple was actually good enough I added it to my favorites to make at home.  That Island Mango Punch however was terrible.  I tasted no mango or pineapple juice, only A LOT of water and some horrifically low grade OJ concentrate.  Not cool.  It was the first reason I chose to close our check and not order anything else.  

The second reason?  A 30 minute ticket time on two non-special order signature drinks.  Either the bartender is new or needs to be.  

Right around the halfway point on our drinks, the serene silence was crushed to dust by the talents of a pair of musicians whose speakers volume knobs were turned to the stops.  Please take note, those two can SING!  Some of the best covers of Michael Jackson favorites and even a few newer songs that impressed the hell out of us both.  Had the volumes been turned down below the 900db level, we would have stayed longer.  My advice is simple, bring ear plugs.  No joke, it was LOUD.  

Chef Brain
The servers were all fantastic!  Very attentive, but they would also leave us alone while we were talking unless our glasses were empty.    

Since we did not order food, I won't even speculate on how the kitchen staff performs here.  I've read the reviews, but I can only say that no employee ever suggested that we eat on property.  We were in contact with close to a dozen people working at the resort, but not one of them said that we needed to try some plate in one of their restaurants.  I take that lack of enthusiasm to heart as someone who still suggests certain locations I'm familiar with from my past to total strangers.  I don't get a kick back.  I just know that the food is that good.  When a dozen people agree enough that they don't say a word?  I'm going to listen.  

All I will say about the food, based entirely on reading the menu, is that there needs to be more variety from location to location, more originality in general, and (for those prices) it better be scratch made.  Pulled pork and pulled chicken in more than one thing each on a high priced menu?  Seriously?  I have ordered food on a satisfied, and sometimes full, stomach just because the menu was that impressive and I just had to try it.  Dining out is supposed to be done because these dishes are unique and cannot be found somewhere else, not ""Well, it's open and we are already here.""  A restaurant so good people drag friends and family out on an hour long drive one way, and brag about their loyalty to every employee they see when they arrive.  ""I can't wait to see what they've got tonight!""  Was a common remark made at several of my former jobs.  Those are the type of places I've worked.  Those are the places I search for.  Those are the places I still tell strangers on the street they need to make the special trip just to try it out.",0
5064348,1,"I, along with three of my co-workers, indulge in the happy hour at Desi Vega's a few times a month. We sit at the bar and partake in good times and conversation. The food is excellently priced and good proportions.

We usually sit at the bar, and the past few times, the bartender - a female with curly hair - has been nothing but rude and disappointing. We each usually spend about $50, which probably isn't much to her, but I think it's a pretty good amount if there are 4-5 of us = $200!

However, her service is sub-par to say the least, and her despicable, disgusting attitude is so disappointing that I would be complimenting her calling her a decent human being. Her lack of a simple smile and a warm greeting is disturbing for a fine dining restaurant.

We work for the federal government and have traveled around the world - from Canada to Dubai, from Mexico to Zimbabwe - and she truly is the worst individual I have ever met in my adult life (not just in the service industry). Her complete lack of caring for her job and others makes me write this comment, and I STRONGLY urge no one ever patronize such a restaurant that employs this mentality.

We sat down at the bar, and she rolled her eyes and mumbled something under her breath. She poured us one drink and we sat there for three hours without a refill. She did not take our food order, did not even acknowledge our presence afterwards.

6178334,1,"We would not recommend Tampa Bay Pools to anyone, and are unhappy with how this business treats their customers.

1. Sloppy Work: Corners not centered, cement on tiles, holes in coping, careless/rushing lack of detail.

2. Unprofessional: It's like climbing a mountain dealing with the warranty process to get something fixed. Lack of communication, rudeness, and worst of all, workers show up to your house and come into your lanai with no warning or heads up. Closes work orders without ensuring customer is OK with the work.

3. Poor Quality: Will install the basic/cheapest equipment and not provide options for better equipment. Does not take ownership of issues and blames the customer. Points fingers at the customer for not being a pool expert.

Overall, we are completely unsatisfied with this business and its employees, and will be telling neighbors, friends, and others to stay away. There are MANY other quality pool contractors around who install much better products and take care of their customers. Happy to discuss our experience with anyone who is exploring building a pool with Tampa Bay Pools.",0

Yo Sushi is located in the center of International Plaza and your food arrives to you via a conveyor belt that sends pre-made dishes that you can pick up yourself. I suppose this is the fun part of the dining experience, because the hefty prices they charged for each plate was not fun. I decided to eat some raw tuna and rice and then promptly left.

1992711,1,"I'm writing this review with substantial regret because I do love this place. I crave their soft shell crab and meatball po boys. However, my problem isn't with the food; it's with the management and staff. 

Phase I in Louisiana either requires or recommends that staff wear masks to protect themselves and patrons. This was not done, at all. In addition, a member of the staff was irresponsibly making light of the situation to a table of senior citizens. None of this inspired confidence with regard to the safe consumption of the food we had just purchased. 

I would have requested a refund, but did not want to remain in the restaurant long enough to awkwardly do so. We were forced to dispose of the sandwiches and seek lunch elsewhere and at a place responsibly reopening.

It was a disappointing mix of way too many peppers and onions and a small amount of ground beef, although the shell was nice and crispy. My son ordered beef nachos and was sad to see a small serving despite the $8.99 price. My wife ordered the beef quesadilla and felt it was a good sized order but nothing special. The cheese dip was like any other goat cheese type dip others offer. Bottom line is for the price there are much better Mexican restaurants close by and we will not be returning unless we are getting a to go order of salsa.",0

Salsa was the most bland salsa I've ever almost tasted.  Absolutely no flavor, no spice... Nothing.  Pico was tomatoes, onion and water, meh.  
Food arrived, chicken enchiladas were at least as good as the elementary school cafeteria but no better.  Chico's tacos have left me wondering if I need to sleep near the toilet.

3811003,1,"I wish there was a zero star option...  After inspecting and noting that there was a small scuff/rip on back bottom of the sectional I agreed to purchase because I liked the piece enough to do so, after all a small scuff on the bottom back is easy to hide. When delivered, I watched the delivery men take it off the truck and through the door with ease, after an additional examination while delivery men were still present I found an 8-10' scrape along the top back of the couch. When I contacted the store, I put my cell on speaker phone so everyone could hear, my sales person Parker blamed his delivery men and began to raise his voice at me, he continued to saying ""that's how you purchased it!"" As I said ""no it was not"" he yelled back in a hostile tone ""yes it is!"" And the delivery man even volunteered to get on the phone and reiterate to him that we were speaking about a completely different area than the scuff on the bottom, salesman did not care, continuing to forcefully argue, so unprofessionally, and blaming delivery guys (which, even if it was the delivery guys fault, why should that be my problem and be yelled at for that?!) Parker hung up on me. The head manager (or owner) called on the delivery guys phone and asked to speak to me, when he did he instantly started arguing with me, I had to keep saying ""sir, please listen to me, you need to stop and listen to me"" he would not stop and claimed their as is policy has been stated.

4239816,1,"I've experienced strange massages before but this one was pretty high on the list. I got a Groupon for a massage plus relaxation treatments - whatever that means. I booked online and got my appointment for an evening after work. When I arrived there was no one around. I sat down in the lobby and noticed the ""new client"" clipboard sitting there so I just grabbed it and filled in my info so I was ready to go. The masseuse was running behind obviously so I was hoping I'd speed things along. I waited probably 15 minutes past my appointment. The lobby was small but looked nicely put together.

The masseuse came out of the room he'd been working in and greeted me. He seemed nice enough but he was extremely chatty while getting my info put in the computer. After the last client dressed and left he went back to change the sheets. He asked me to come back so he could talk to me while changing sheets. I'm not a chatty person so I didn't like awkwardly standing in the hall answering questions about myself while he cleaned. He took the old sheets off and wadded them up and stuck them under the table. He put a new sheet on and told me to get undressed to my comfort level and he'd be back. I didn't see him wash his hands after coming out from his last client so I really hope he did after he left me to undress. 

The room itself was pretty decent looking and the table was comfortable. I got undressed like normal and got under the sheet. When he came back he made awkward remarks about how it was a judgement free zone, etc which was odd to me. He asked if I was comfortable before doing anything saying he tries to be careful not to make women who may have been sexually assaulted uncomfortable. I guess gold star for trying but that's not a thought I like while trying to relax. 

During the massage he kept sighing loudly and saying ""beautiful"". He tried telling me he thinks it's ""beautiful"" to see a muscle knot worked out but that's a super weird reaction for a masseuse IMO. When I was face up and he was working on my shoulders I could feel his breathing on my skin and face. He bent over way far and his stomach was almost on my face. I could feel his shirt grazing my nose. And he got a bit too close to my rear for comfort while working on my legs and back. No idea which of those was the ""relaxation treatment"".

A few times he worked muscles way too hard and it really hurt. His cell phone went off at one point. He talked a lot during the massage too which irritates me to no end. Read the room, dude. I'm not there to tell my life's story nor am I enthusiastically elaborating in my responses. I'm there to relax. In silence. After the massage I got dressed and went out. There was another poor soul waiting in the lobby. I paid and he asked me for a hug before I left. I've never been so weirded out by a massage experience.",0

At first I thought that was a sign that they were making the meat nice and fresh and that it was going to make the experience that much better. NOPE! The meat was bland and tasteless. The sandwich had no flare or nothing. It was so....dead and sad. Such a waste of calories.

840908,1,"I have never had such a disturbing, uncomfortable experience with a server in my life.

Our group of 20 arrived in bits for an 8pm reservation on a Saturday. We were seated right away, but were spread across 3 separate tables. The tables were near enough for it not to be a problem, though it meant lots of getting up to visit with others at the other tables.

Service was slow overall, but nothing that couldn't be excused with the size of our group and a Saturday night visit.

My first issue was with the menus. We were given around 6-8 menus for 20 people. At my table of 6, that meant 2 for 3 couples to share. I asked our server for more menus, but he said they were out. Meanwhile, I watched the host seat several other tables where each person received their own menu. I resorted to using my smartphone and their online menu.

We ordered drinks and asked for waters. The server told us they were out of water glasses. But, when we got our drinks (and much, much later, a total of 3 waters for our table of 6) I noticed that the water glasses were EXACTLY the same glasses as many of the mixed drinks and famous bloody Marys came in. Hmmm.

The food was okay - not bad, not amazing, and we loved the drinks. It's a vodka bar, after all. After 2 hours of eating and drinking, we began to ask for our checks. We were unsure whether they had a large group - no multiple checks policy, and would have dealt with it either way. 

But, since they apparently were on board to give out multiple checks, the first couple (eager to get home to their young baby) asked for theirs. The waiter complained that people were switching tables and he didn't know what anyone had. He said it would be a long time before he had them ready. Then, on second thought, he turned and said ""Unless anyone absolutely has to leave now..."" 

Patiently, the couple went through the list with him and told him what they'd had. From him, they'd ordered only their meals - having ordered their drinks directly from the bar. The waiter accused them of lying, saying in a very stern, disbelieving voice: ""Are you SURE you ordered from the bar?""

A while later he returned with their check and they paid. He then asked if anyone else needed their check. Turn by turn, each person/couple told him what they had, enduring complaints from him throughout, such as ""If there's money left at the end it comes out of my own pocket."" We weren't trying to stiff him in any way!! 

He told us waiting tables is ""A very stressful job,"" but never once apologizing for his poor attitude. He told one friend that ""You had a Saki."" She said, ""no, I didn't,"" and he said ""Yes you did."" (She hadn't had a saki, but my husband had, which I told him minutes before.)

We waited for 15 or so minutes, when a woman came out and told us that our waiter had become ""very confused"" and that she would sort out our checks. She asked each person, again, to list what they'd had. Meanwhile, our original server avoided us. Another 15-20 minutes went by and finally we had our checks. As a former server myself, it was very hard for me to not tip 20%, but I couldn't. The server was rude, defensive, and all-around unpleasant. I will not be back.",0

THE BEER;

Now for the fun part:  after saying no, she said you can buy tastes of 4 oz. for whatever price (I forgot). I stuck to an IPA rather getting something I would dislike. Our table mate got some type of Resurrection brew, he was more adventurous than I.  It came in an 8 oz snifter type goblet that was 1/3 full of beer and 2/3 full of head--ARE YOU KIDDING ME.

To explain exactly why, I will rewind time to last Sunday, my husband and I came in early afternoon for two bowls of pho, mine veggie pho no tofu, no bok choy and no crispy onion, my husband ordered the veggie pho just as it comes... we also ordered tofu spring rolls. The spring rolls came to the table with shrimp. My veggie pho had no bok choy, no tofu, no onions at all not even the raw onion or green onion that usually come in the soup. My husband had no bok choy in his soup at all, and he ordered his the regular way, still not an issue we just requested a side of onions and they changed out the spring rolls for the tofu ones. When the bill came the girl who took our order overcharged us, and when we noticed she fixed the bill... strike one. 
Friday we stop in for another bowl of soup, I ordered the veggie pho no tofu, no bok choy, this time just leaving in the crispy onions (I would rather pick them out), my husband ordered the teriyaki tofu. We also ordered the tofu spring rolls. The soup comes to the table and it's filled with tofu, so I picked it all out. Still not a big deal, the server assured us she put the order in without tofu, but the cook does what he wants. The basil in the spring rolls was awful and purple, almost slimy. My husband ended up getting really sick to his stomach that night, and since we had eaten everything the same except for the tofu teriyaki I can only assume it was from that. Strike two. 
Today being in the area and it being slightly rainy we decided to stop in and grab a bowl of pho for lunch. We skipped our usual order of tofu spring rolls since they were not very fresh on Friday. Instead we ordered two large veggie pho, no tofu no bok choy. The order came out fairly quickly. The basil was still a bit on the dark side today, not a big deal, we picked off the fresh leaves. We put all our toppings into the bowl of soup, and as I am mixing it up, I noticed what appeared to be a worm (a white worm) in my broccoli! I called the server over who had me scoop it into her hand and she brought it to whoever is the manager? Maybe even the owner (not sure what his title was). He came back to the table and confirmed that yes, this was a ""vegetable worm"" and that this has happened a few times, and I would not be charged for my soup. As much as I appreciate this and his apology I just can not return. That was strike three for us, in one week!! 
I'm very understanding, I do know bugs can get into produce but when I have visited this location 3 times in one week and they fail to get my order correct or there are worms in my soup I just can not go back! There are plenty of other pho places in town with wonderful veggie pho and FRESH vegetables! I always order no bok choy in my soup here because it always has dark black spots on it!

So I asked to see the manager, who quickly agreed to seat us at arguably the worst table in the restaurant, but at least it was 15 degrees cooler there. From the piano in the entrance to the bar to the entire dining room, it was so loud that we had to shout at each other to be heard. The food was ok,  thing great. The shrimp and grits was literally swimming in oil probably from too much cheese in the grits, but the shrimp were cooked perfectly, the beef short ribs were sitting on about a pound of mashed potatoes (even when my mom asked for a half portion of the potatoes). The ceviche was mostly cilantro and cucumber and I am sure the shrimp was cooked first, not really ceviche. Finally, our waiter, she was great!

So now, she says Corazza won't see my daughter over $40, sent to collections and was paid before it was ever sent.  My daughter has 4 forms of insurance,  I've never owed a copay.  I paid it because it was easier to deal with and now my daughter is screwed.   Being one of the few neurologists in town, they seem to only want to deal with cash paying folks.  Baffles me.  It's sad really.

Good luck getting an answer from Nancy or Gwen in collections.",0
6450049,1,"I am writing from my daughter's account. My name is Ketan Bhakta

I have been a regular customer at this Toyota company in Reno like a couple days ago. I had bought a 2018 Toyota Camry for my daughter recently (about 5 months ago) when this terrible innocent had happened. My daughter, my wife, and I were going to Reno and while we were on the freeway, the rear driver's tire completely popped while my daughter, who was driving, was going 80 mph. We were about to go into a ditch, but my daughter swerved away from and it and we were going into the other ditch before she turned again. WE then spun around two full times at 80 miles per hour before we finally stopped. When we stopped, the car was facing the completely opposite direction of Reno. Luckily there were no cars or trucks otherwise we would've been easily killed. The car did not flip over. I called Toyota and they refused to replace the tires with a different brand. They refused to replace the Bridgestone tires which is the only request I had. I told all my loved ones the horrible service I have received and advise people to buy from this dealership. My entire family and I would've have been killed.",0
370777,1,"The one star is for the staff outside the pharmacy. Those staff outside the pharmacy make this store the only reason to go inside. The pharmacy staff, on the other hand, could not possibly care less about their patients. They don't even try to pretend that they do. I would love to say that this is based on a single experience, but it has been based in many experiences. I hope this isn't a Walgreens wide mentality, as I will be trying to find a better Walgreens pharmacy. I'd go back to CVS if it weren't for the fact that Tricare switched us.",0
1967597,1,"It has taken me weeks to settle down. If I had written this review three weeks ago it would have contained a lot of expletives.
My Mom did not have the opportunity to choose a hospital. It was an emergency admission. In fact the hospital we went to had a psych floor. Only to be informed after waiting fours hours for a crisis worker to evaluate her,that the floor was full and had a waiting list for admission.
I will try to keep this simple-BEWARE!!!!!
Communication with family members was substandard-unless you pushed for it. It was nearly impossible to speak to the psychiatrist. I was given his office number 2x by staff-only to find out it was wrong! The social workers name and phone number given to me by staff( I left message for her three times) only to find out she no longer works there. In fact there was only one Social Worker for the entire floor of patients. She was very nice & overworked.
The Nurses did provide my Mom with kindness(she even sent them a thank you note). Her meds were on point. So not all bad.
However, its a sad state of affairs when the patient(my Mom)recognized her name&photo identifying her outside of her room did not match. Maybe that's why the doctor confused her with another patient. She folded this in half only showing her name. It was changed seven days later.
Discharge time(even confirming it)was a mess. Doctor did not write script for new meds. Discharge summary not sent to PCP. My Mom ended up at PCP the next morning with UTI. When PCP office called nurses station for summary(not even 24 hours later)they were told
patient had to request it. I then placed a call to the nurses station to straighten out. However, the person who answered the phone was not a nurse but a patient. Who told me they were busy and she was allowed to answer the phone.
I was BEYOND my limit with continuous disbelief of lack of care. The admissions department made sure a nurse called PCP and discharge with current meds were sent to PCP. 
I left message for CFO and she did call me the next day. She assured me she would look into my grievances and was a bit taken back by my complaints. She did confirm the lack of Social Workers.
Is this the state of Mental Health Care? I hope not. My Mom had three strong advocates. What happens to those patients who have none. SHAME ON YOU HAVEN!!!!",0
1729854,2,"The hype and expectation didn't live up to the actual experience and meal. We waited 11 months to eat here and we were disappointed after the build-up.

We both had the E. Sea Rider with grilled grouper, shrimp and scallops skewers on a rice pilaf. It was fresh but bland, unfortunately. There was just little to no seasoning. And the hush puppies were below average.

We had decent service and sat outside on a busy afternoon, but really had no view.  Their reservation system was great - they use the Nowait app and it enabled us to shop on Dodecanese Boulevard while the 36 parties ahead of us were sat. 

The price was average and we will definitely go back but not immediately.",0

We were a table of 13, and getting our food was difficult. Our food came out over a period of 35 minutes. And then some of it was completely wrong. And then employees were upset that we weren't happy with our wrong meals. And then sat down at the bar and complained so we could hear her. Her specific name was Kiki she's apparently an expo worker in the kitchen, she is completely UNPROFESSIONAL and DISGUSTINGLY RUDE! She should find a job where she doesn't work in customer service. She made multiple loud comments about us. It was such a terrible experience. We are coming back next year and will make sure we avoid this restaurant.

I fell asleep waiting on my pizza but I don't think it took that long, only took 2 hours to deliver it. The guy who delivered my pizza woke me up and honestly I didn't even remember ordering anything. I even asked him if he was sure that it was my pizza. I tipped him $1 and I think because of that, the pizza tasted horrible. That was the worst pizza I've ever had! I threw it outside and on my way to work the next morning I saw at least 10 rats laying on their back flat dead. It didn't take me long to realize that was the result of them eating the pizza I had thrown out. Anyways, I want to thank Pizza Hut for helping the neighborhood get rid of this many rats at once, way to go!",0

5415640,1,"I went to purchase a used car, of which would require my first auto loan. I have been a member of TCAFCU for over 15 years, and their website says they offer a ""First Time Auto Buyers Program"" so figured it was a good start to see what they could offer me.

I applied and was approved for the full $15,000 loan, with NO co-signer. Unfortunately, things fell through with the car(private seller), and the loan expired within the 30 days. Less than 20 days later, I reapplied for the same loan and they only approved my for 80% of the same loan. When asking my loan specialist, why the difference, she had said it was because they outsource their underwriters and that they had internal staff changes. She said it had NOTHING to do with my credit history etc. (my credit score is a 711 !!!)

When asking my loan specialist about the First Time Auto Buyer Program, she had no idea what it even was. She needed to put me on hold to find out, then preceded to tell me that ""it wasn't really a program, just saying they work with first time auto loan applicants and may not require a co-signer or lower interest rates for those with no previous auto history"". I then proceeded to tell her, that that is false advertisement, because they in fact were penalizing me for coming back to apply for an auto loan with them. If they approved me less than a month ago, for the full loan amount, and then only 80% of the loan 3 weeks later. (AGAIN, not having anything to do with me or my credit history - just internal staff changes). 

After being a member of this credit union for so long, you would think they would want to help. Instead, I am probably better off going through a dealership for a better interest rate and full loan approval. I do not recommend this credit union. I will be pulling my account and transferring it elsewhere after the lack of patronage.",0

I had a 1:45 pm pick up time and didn't receive food until 4:05 pm. I had to get out in the cold/windy/rainy temps to check as no updates were made via text once I checked in. They brought my food to me right away once I caught one of the girls to ask about my order that was over 2 hours past my pick up time. The unacceptable part was my pick up receipt ticket had a 3:25pm print time and I had to physically get out of my car to get it at 4:05pm and no one made an effort to provide it to my vehicle and who knows how much longer I would have waited had I not gotten out of my car to check...which their signage on the door clearly says not to do. I saw multiple people leave after 2+ hours of waiting without any food. I feel if management could have been proactive to come out and let curbside patrons know what was going on and offer an apology that would have gone a long way, but no apologies were made.

2637049,1,"First time My fiancé and I ordered from Casey's we used Uber eats.  They forgot the Cole slaw on my pulled pork sandwich (which makes the sandwich) so when I called to talk to them about it- the lady that answered said- there's nothing we can do, call Uber eats. I was like- oh, okay. (Thought that was unprofessional) but I did. Gave them a second chance a few weeks ago, decided after working at the hospital all day, I would call Casey's MYSELF, place the order and pick it up on my way home. (Thought that would omit the Uber eats issue). I get there, they give me my order, I get out to my car- check my order before I leave- ITS WRONG. Same sandwich. Only this time- no Cole slaw or cheese on the sandwich. (These are the two things it is supposed to come with already on it). With chips on the side.  I didn't get chips, or Cole slaw or cheese. I go back in- explain it's wrong- she takes it back to the kitchen- they throw a few slices of cheese on it, don't melt it, forget the Cole slaw and tell me my fries are in the bag already.  (I didn't even order fries).  One of the managers called me later on that evening, half an apology, trying to justify why my ordering made it turn out wrong. Offered me a gift card.  I didn't even call her back to get it.  We will no longer be eating at Casey's.  It's a shame.",0
2534429,1,"I really am unsure as how to proceed. How to relate to others the absolute disdain I have for this restaurant and especially the wife of the Owner. This woman is basically the ""soup nazi"" in pumps...
I have made reservations for every foray into this place and have tried to give them every benefit of the doubt. However, even though we had reservations for a particular time one evening, it was never written down and I even explained to her to whom I had spoken. It didn't matter; it was the middle of winter and she asked us to go outside and wait until she called us. Reluctantly, we did this and waited outside for 15 minutes and then just left. It happened again last night where I had called, made reservations and showed up on time. She treated us with pretension, condescension, and arrogance, so we left yet again. And in her passive aggressive way she was happy to say ""goodbye""...mean girl syndrome.

The food in this establishment is good (if you like undercooked vegetables)but the setting is extremely problematic. The reception area is cluttered, crowded and virtually unworkable.
In addition, previously, on two separate occasions, we made our way to our table, our waiter came and gave us water and then disappeared. After about 25 minutes we complained and asked what happened to him. We were told""oh, he went home.""
Basically, if you expect service and promptness in your waitstaff you're in the wrong place. However, if you enjoy a crowded,cluttered,chaotic environment where the owner thinks she's doing you a favor by letting you in...it should be a perfect experience.

We go to restaurants four times a week and over the course of many years in Tucson I've seen the same attitude with a number of other different restaurants who are no longer in business. I hope this will be the next one to go; it may take a little time but this attitude will catch up with them sooner or later.

4460345,2,"Oh Lambert.

Poor, poor Lambert.  My heart breaks for thee.

You were once a hub, a nerve center for the most traveled suitcase-carrying businessmen and women in America.  The movers and shakers all traveled to and from you, your warm bustling concourses beaming with life.  In the 1990's you were the #8 airport in all of America in terms of volume.  There was too much congestion and the city bought out surrounding housing and bulldozed them to make way for a bright shiny new runway to support the flight traffic. 

And then something happened.

TWA went belly up.  American Airlines cut your hub status.  And Anheuser Busch got bought out by some Belgian company.  As a metro area, St. Louis stagnated while other cities grew.

From 2000 to 2009, you lost half of your travelers.  Half.  50 percent.  Ouch.

It used to be that going to visit you was a hassle.  Long lines, long waits, crowded gates.  Now it's not a hassle anymore.  It's sad.  I can breeze right into you at almost any time of day without a problem.  What once were busy shops and restaurants are shut down or empty.  Everything about you is stuck in the 80's.  The decor, the technology, the signage, even some of the people.  Sometimes I wonder if you even know what the internet is.

I guess it's not all bad.  I don't wait very long anymore in your security lines, and check-in is easy.  I never have to fight to find a parking spot.  There's not a long wait if I want a coffee.  And I don't have to wait very long to get my luggage.  But a part of me still misses the old you.  When you were strong and confident and growing.  It pains me to see you weak and frail and collapsing.  

They built your new runway, finally.  It's no longer needed.  I think it's used, once in a while at least.  But they had to knock down all those houses to build it and spend all that money, instead of giving you the face lift you so desperately need.

Sometimes when I visit you I don't know where to go.  Your signs are vague and misleading, and I have to double-back or loop around to get myself straightened out.  Wait, how do I get on westbound 70 again?  Which way to the car rental returns?  Why does that exit say airport when it just takes you to an open field?  No wonder people don't like visiting you, you make yourself hard to find and harder to leave.

I don't know why, but even though you're located in the county, you're owned by the city of St. Louis.  It's a sad parallel.  What happened to the city in the 50's and 60's (mass exodus) happened to you in the 00's.  You're trying to jump start yourself, but nothing really works.  As of 2010, your largest carrier will be Southwest Airlines, located in the auxillary (east) terminal, and the main terminal will be a shadow of its former self, losing all hub status.

I don't know what to tell you, Lambert.  You had your moment of glory and now it's gone.  You keep wearing skinny ties and members only jackets and oakley sunglasses, but it's the 10's.  It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.  These kids today don't remember you back in the day.  They only know you as a lonely old man clinging on for life, depressed and confused on how to approach the future.  I know you have it in you.  You can be great again, but it takes hard work and dedication, and I'm not seeing any of that from you.  Don't take this personally, but you're just not the airport you used to be.",0
1647569,2,"we came in during the afternoon and there was nothing there except for the tree, the sign, and a lot of closed stores. I understand that they will open later on in the evening, but during the day, it was not that interesting ...

5441524,2,"I should have read the reviews more carefully, but this was a convenient location to meet a friend and Cajun/Creole is always enticing. I figured: how bad can it be? 

Disappointing. 

The menu situation was a bad sign: an oversized laminated menu had lunch and dinner printed front and back. An extensive (and significantly more expensive) printed list of appetizer and entree specials was presented in a classic restaurant menu sleeve--it looked like a complete menu for a small BYOB. There was a beer list. A separate wine list. And upon request a cocktail list. I'd been hoping for something like a Sazerac or an Absinthe, but with the exception of a Hurricane the cocktail list reminded me of a fraternity happy hour. I needed a drink to deal with the menu overload.

As to the food: Other than the crawfish bisque (which was good, but slung diner-style onto the table and sloshed all over the wide rims of the shallow bowls), everything we had was over-seasoned and/or overly sweet. 

Maybe the entrees were better; we shared a bunch of appetizers.

The crawfish and jalapeño appetizer was a generous pile of deep fry (couldn't identify the crawfish) with what I swear was off-the-shelf Chinese sweet-and sour sauce. And nearly inedibly hot. But I'm a chili head--I enjoyed it, red faced and sweating. The heat overwhelmed the sweet sauce.

The bourbon crawfish appetizer was an sticky sweet mass of what I guess were crawfish tails--maybe chopped up, because they weren't recognizable by shape--and onions, over rice.

Alligator sausage over rice featured an innocuous sausage (tastes like chicken!) over overcooked rice. In yet another sticky sweet spicy sauce. Again with lots of onion. 

The two kids both ordered the bisque and pierogies. They forgot the pierogies. 20 minutes later they delivered one order of pierogies. Which was just fine because they were covered is so much Cajun (or Creole) seasoning the kids had to scrape it off with a spoon. And again, a pile of cooked onion.

My friend ordered a Caesar salad with the dressing on the side. It arrived: a couple handfuls of bagged romaine with a few boxed croutons and tiny dices of nearly white tomato. With a side of commercial Caesar dressing. She politely said that it wasn't what she'd expected for the price and asked to send it back. The waitress was apologetic and took it back to the kitchen--but then returned it to the table with the message that the manager said ""that's the way we make it"". Wow. 

The atmosphere was nice and the live band was great--but if you're looking for good Cajun/Creole food... make the drive down to the St George's Country store for the real thing.",0

She brought 2 side salads out 30 minutes after we ordered but gave my friend's salad to the table next to us - when we brought it to her attention she acted as if it wasn't a big deal and then brought her side salad out with her dinner - she said she forgot to make it.  Usually the food is good but this was awful.  The plates were smoking hot like they sat under the heat light forever.

I'm not sure if it was a crappy waitress or if the kitchen could have contributed to this huge delay but it took the 4 of us 2 1/2 hours to eat dinner... ridiculous.  I will say this is the 3rd time I've eaten here and the service hasn't gotten much better since the 1st time I was here over a year ago.",0
2000682,1,"I was extremely disappointed by my visit here. I feel like the decor is nice and makes you expect a good experience, but mine was not that. I ordered a baked pastry covered soup and sandwich.

 My soup was ice cold when it arrived. I'm not sure what kind of oven they have but it clearly doesn't do the job. I went and explained the issue and they put it back in the oven, and once I received it again the soup was STILL not hot but the pastry was now burnt. How is that something that should be served?

My grilled cheese sandwich came rock hard and not warm at all. I simply returned it.

The coffee was also terrible? I'm so confused how a coffee shop can serve mediocre coffee. I would say it reminded me of Second Cup (which is not a compliment) but I was expecting more of a local, artisan coffee especially for the prices.

Do yourself a favour and skip this joint.",0

No, we would love our drinks.  So he blamed it on the bar and left.  Came back with a full drink for both of us.  I really just wanted to sample the cider (which tasted like any bottled cider the local grocery store offers), but decided to just take it.  Husband's beer (Boise Pale Ale) wasn't very good either.  Nachos were delivered by someone else.  Server came back after another 20 min or so (really?) and asked how everything was.  We said it was fine.

4294471,2,"For our family vacation this year we selected GSR due to all the non-gambling activities that are offered which include, driving range, movie theater, arcade, and shopping.

Since there are six of us we need to do some creative booking.  I reserved a Grand Summit Suite with a Connector Room.  We asked for the connector room to have two queen beds.  This would cost approx. $950 for two nights.  While over $400 per night it was in the Summit Tower and no smoking so I was fine with the expense.

We arrived at about 1:30PM and were allowed access to the main suite but the connector room was not ready.  We were fine with that and determined to come back later.  When we returned to the room approximately 5:30PM the room was still locked.  We had to contact the front desk as check in is 3:00PM and the expectation is our room would be available.  Turns out the person had not checked out and was too busy gambling to pack up their belongings and get out.  Security had to pack everything and then housekeeping was finally able to clean the room.  We had to wait five and a half hours after official check-in time to get in the room at 8:30PM.

When I said this was just not acceptable I was given an $80 dollar voucher for dinner for four at the Buffet or Café.  This was not good anywhere else.  So we used it at the buffet but our total was less than fifty dollars and we were told it could only be used once...when we entered. So if we wanted to add say a mimosa or some other adult beverage once we were at the table we could not.  So our $80 voucher became $50.  The total for the two rooms was reduced our room charge by $158 total for the weekend.

In addition to the above I doubt I would ever stay by choice at GSR for the following reasons:
* Kitchen - No Dishes, cutlery, utensils, paper towels, or cookware.  What is the point of a kitchen that you cannot use?  When I called about this I was told I could have cutlery if I ordered room service.  There were two water glasses included on the counter top for a suite that sleeps four.  We could not prepare or eat any of the food we brought.
* Power on Desk for computers.  There was no outlet within twenty feet of the desk so there was no way to plug/charge any devices on the desk.
* No dresser at all in the room.  Clothes had to be stored in the desk drawers in the living area.
* The connector room was supposed to have two queen beds.  This room only had one.  Fortunately my other daughter cancelled at the last minute.
* Once housekeeping was finally finished cleaning the connector room they left dirty towels hanging on the back of the bathroom door.
* There were dozens of children running, playing and yelling, up and down the halls day and night with no parental supervision.

If I ever do stay at GSR again I would book a regular hotel room with no extras since that is essentially what received but not what we were charged for in this instance.  While the rooms were large and had a great view my experience was less than 'Grand'!",0
67357,2,"We didn't really have a good experience at this place . To start with we had to wait about 30 min in spite of a reservation . And then we were seated in a back room next to a very noisy and drunk group of girls . Not the restaurants fault - but they could have seated us someplace else. The menu was extremely limited - with a very dew options to pick from. I got the mushroom pizza - which wasn't anythibg great . My husband and another friend ordered the lamb entree and they weren't impressed either. Another friend ordered their margarita pizza and that was probably tge best thjbg on the table.

The moussaka was dried out, yet oily and most likely heated up in a microwave, as it was piping hot in comparison to the rest of the food, chicken was fatty and the hummus below par.

Anyone who says their quote is only good if you buy today and install the next day because they miraculously had just one more spot open ""tomorrow"" is a good indicator of a scam job. They promote all of these guarantees in order to justify their price, but from reading these reviews it is obvious they have no intention of following their own guarantee. The back-and-forth ""negotiation"" with her boss on speakerphone was unbelievable. Stay away. You can do much much better by going to recommendations from the app Next Door.

I clean the lint filter after each use. My old Whirlpool never had a lint buildup issue. I would never have gotten this dryer had I known there is a problem. When I said that to her, she told me ""Sales people don't know about problems with appliances. They only sell them.""

4170356,1,"Defy is a local trampoline spot that has been great in the past.  We've taken several of our grand kids there with no issues.  

Sunday July 26th, Defy opens at 11:00 and we reserve a time at 11:15 to bring our Grand Daughters in.  We get to the front and a very nice young lady greets us to tell us that Defy is not open yet.  Seems the guy with the keys has not shown up to open the business......? 

Okay so we stroll around the outlets for a bit and come back at 11:30.  The door is open, we're in business.  They nice young lady treated us well and gave us a discount for our inconvenience, which was greatly appreciated.  

Off come the shoes and my wife starts looking for a locker.  She had to try 4 before she found one that locked..... The first three were not in working order...? 

In we go with our grand daughters....  One of our grand daughters wanted to swing out on what I'll call the trapeze.  In the past employees were up on the platform to pull the trapeze in, not today.  There were several milling about but no help so I climbed up on the platform to pull the trapeze in.  Our grand daughter swung out then swung back then out again before letting go.  As this occurred a young man wearing a Defy black shirt and a backwards SF baseball cap approached my wife and said something to her.  When I asked my wife what was said she told me that apparently you can only swing out, not back.  I looked around, no sign, nothing posted on the walls.  Maybe if they were so concerned that they had to have words with my wife, they should have been up on the platform doing their jobs... 

Our 1.5 hours is almost up and my wife and I were sitting, talking. The  same young man comes up to us and tells us he's been giving us a break but we have to put masks on. Really, we've been there for almost an hour and a half, there are adults and kids all over running around without masks and we get targeted by the same kid....?  My guess he has some sort of ego issue and feels the need to tell adults what to do.  Either that or Covid 19 will not effect you in a trampoline park if you're moving or if you've been there less than an hour and a half..... What the HELL.

Lastly, when we went to leave the damn locker would not open and my wife had to get someone with a key.  Another parent was having the same issue... The locker would not unlock.  Again, what the HELL, you've just been closed for 4 months.  You couldn't fix the lockers during the 4 months....

I wanted 3 legs and a thigh and my mom the 10 shrimp combo. I got 2 legs and a thigh on one plate, a thigh on another, and my mom paid for a 10 shrimp combo, but got a 3 shrimp combo. I told the guy I wanted 3 legs and a thigh not 2 of each. Instead of taking the plate with only a thigh and replace it with a leg, he took the plate with the 2 legs and a thigh. He didn't throw them out either, and I think I might've sneezed on them a little. He put them right back on the tray. Now we had our food, we thought the bad part was over. We thought we'd wash our hands and eat. They don't have a working bathroom. We had to come around back and use the kitchen sink. Again, now we thought it was just eating the food and getting out.

1535780,1,"THIS IS THE LAST PLACE YOU WANT TO LIVE!!! 

I have lived here for over a year. When we first moved in, everything was fine, or so we thought....2 days after moving in we could smell gas inside our home. We called emergency maintenance and they came out and we were told it was the water heater exhaust which points straight down on our patio. Nothing was done to fix it. My girlfriend was pregnant so keep this in mind as you read about this horribly ran place which was almost shut down by NV Energy. From the end of April to December we could occasionally smell gas, but it would go away. We called maintenance 2-3 more times as we thought maybe it was the gas fireplace. They said they couldn't smell it We were baffled at what was the cause. Finally January 21, 2016 we could not take it anymore. We called again as the smell had grown more consistent. Maintenance came and brought their ""sniffer device"" which is used to detect gas in the air. The maintenance guy called my girlfriend at work and told them he had to call NV Energy because his device detected gas and had turned off all of the gas in our home. We came home and found an emergency tag from NV Energy for ""Hazard Conditions"" and it was stated our ""Water heater dumping CO from coupling, capped at app valve"". All summer our energy bill was around $250-$280 a month. Keep in mind our bill now is $120 hmmmm.

The office called and said they were bringing us some heaters because we had no heat. Maria, the new office manager from the new management company FPI came with her husband who is the new maintenance supervisor (which is a conflict of interest) and said everything would be fixed tomorrow. They seemed nice, but it was just lip service as Maria will never take responsibility when your unit has a problem. We found out that they fired ""Bob"" who was a really nice maintenance guy, and worked hard on our units with limited resources and staff (most likely from the cheap owners). 

After the gas crisis was resolved our daughter was born and sometimes she chokes for no reason, and NV Energy doesn't want to send us the internal report from incident. We are still working on this. For the last 3 months maintenance has done an overhaul of the all of the units water heater exhaust systems and an anonymous source told us Caviata at Kiley Ranch was almost shut down because the issue was not just our unit but many of them! 

We decided since Maria and FPI management seemed to be fixing stuff we would sign another year. The maintenance people who are very nice but very inexperienced came and replaced our refrigerator water filter. After they left I tried to get a glass of water and no water came out. We called the office and two maintenance people tried to fix it with torches and warped the inside of the freezer plastic claiming the lines must be frozen because we had our freezer setting at 8. Um...refrigerator manufacturers do not allow a setting that the freezer cannot handle. Turns out the filter was backwards. So after roasting the freezer plastic contaminated water comes out of the line, my guess from melted plastic. We still cannot use the water that comes out of the refrigerator. We also complained about the washer machine making a terrible screaming noise, we even recorded the sound on video. They said they ordered the part and we still have to endure the screaming noise when we was our clothes. STILL NOT FIXED EITHER! 

The hot tub at the pool was cold when my son and I went to enjoy it last week

NO BBQs allowed? What? 

No recreation vehicles allowed to park. Look at my photos. 

Then last week the maintenance workers were replacing the carpet from the unit across from us because everyone is moving out. I took a picture of many OSHA violations as there was a worker standing on the roof without any fall protection, harness or lanyard. The first latter was not 3 rungs up from the roof or secured, another OSHA violation, and the latter at the top patio used to climb on the top roof about 24' high was an ""A-frame ladder leaning against patio roof, another OSHA violation. 

Now we just received a phone call from a very rude office lady of Caviata at Kiley Ranch saying if we parked in the  red by the door she would call the police and have us towed! My cleaning lady was dropping off her cleaning supplies because there is no parking closer than 150' away and Caviata at Kiley Ranch maintenance staff parks there all of the when they work in our home. So they can do what they want, but my cleaning lady can't? 

Lastly, some kids in another unit shot out some windows with a BB gun at the construction site next to our community. So we received a highly illegal notice saying all children must have an adult to be outside the apartment.

Secondly, the ambiance is not what I want nor expect for a place of such expense. No one seems follow a dress code, Im pretty tired of feeling overdressed at such a nice place.

The garlic bread we ordered as an appetizer had nothing remarkable about it, and the waitstaff seemed confused when we asked for a bowl of marinara sauce to dip it in.

When I received the bill, the price dropped to $75. BUT I was told I had a rear main  seal leak and possible pan gasket leak as well, the cost of repair if I decided to do it would be $775 and $352. 
Last year I had this engine completely rebuilt ,to include all new head gaskets, all seals/gaskets, water pump, all belts, everything that has wear issues, done 3000 miles ago, by a reputable shop from my home state, a family business I've known for 40 years, they even drove the car for a week after the rebuild checking everything before my picking it up.
I have never seen any oil in my driveway before getting work done here and I don't see anything after, I wiped everything down underneath and waited and watched for oil, not a drop. While I do appreciate their work was done quickly, it is a fairly easy process, I've done many oil changes on many different vehicles, being new to the area and living in a complex I have no choice but to have it done.
I should have brought it to the dealer, the wait would have been worth it,  they charge $29.95 for conventional oil and $15 higher for Synthetic, plus tax of course.

Johnny's is like any other sports bar, many TVs you can't hear, lots of comb overs, 40 year old adolescents, and more than their fare share of frat boys.  Please spare me from the future leaders of America!  

The food was above average.  The table shared the Nachos, all the usual characters, plus lettuce and saucy cheese and beans.  This made for a very good Nachos.  

The Cubano sandwich was good and bad.  The pork, ham, and cheese were great.  They served this monster portion on a small hamburder bun.  From memorry this sandwich was previously served on a more appropriate hoagie roll.  

The onion rings were exceptional.  Big individual pieces that were not greasy.  The serving was very generous.  

After lunch we reconvened over at McGurks, where they had more local beer offerings than Johnny's.

PS. Supposedly they have a body paint day on certain Thursdays.  I understand that they charge extra for hairs in your food on Body paint days??? Like Arnold, ""I will be back.""",0

I tried to motion to him that I'm trying to squeeze into my spot between a truck and sprinter van so I'll need some more space from him but he wouldn't budge. At this point, we were blocking both lanes as I was facing East and he was facing West and another neighbor was trying to get by to his spot so I had no choice but to continue forward, leave my complex, make a u-turn to come back in and try again. This time, I decided to verbally ask him if he could move his truck as I'm trying to park in my assigned parking spot but instead he decided to block both lanes by now standing by his truck with his door wide open. I inched forward and he swung the door open even more to make a statement. As I asked him for some more space to park my car he claimed he already moved forward for me and that I have 'some type of driving there if I can't even park'. Wow, very unwarranted and misogynistic considering the fact that I had no space to even turn my wheel. I live here so quite frankly, I have the right of way. You should be able to conduct your work without obstructing other residences. The other neighbor who was waiting to get to his spot was blown away as well. Courtesy goes a long way fellows!",0

State of the art slot machines and the ugly carpet stench of many drinks having been spilled and cleaned over time.  The casino itself is very large with several rooms for all your gambling needs, i.e. poker, black jack and slots.  The main room is the largest, busiest and the worst, Full of SMOKERS and old people sitting with their walkers, canes and wheelchairs locked into a slot trance.  HEY PEOPLE, LISTEN UP.  Casino's are geared for you to pour money INTO THEM, not the other way around.  I didn't see one happy person there.  On the up side, the crew is nice and pleasant, smiling and saying ""hello"" to you at every turn.  I feel sorry for the non smoking crew members inhaling all that toxic smoke for hours working there.  The place itself is located in one of the less salubrious areas of Tampa.  Will remind you of an unpleasant Mall or Airport, that's how large it is.  Depressing place because of the patrons that go there, not because of the people who work there.

I was told ""it's not bad"", it was still bleeding when I got her. The groomer said it was her fault because she jumped, and the reason why the rest of the cut isn't very good is because she wouldn't stop squirming after she was cut. The hair on her head is still so long it's covering her eyes, and some of her nails weren't even cut causing them all to be uneven.

Well for starters our waitress had the hardest time bringing out a fruit cup for our 13 month daughter. We informed her that we have a hungry toddler and we would like them to bring out the fruit cup first or as soon as possible. First failed attempt. The fruit cup ended up coming out with all of the food. Annoying but I could look past it because we had a few snacks to hold our baby over.  Now here is where things turned left. I ordered shrimp scampi pizza and it was was rather tasteful  at first. No issues....then boom. Car ride home.. HOUSTON WE HAVE A PROBLEM.  No more than 15-20 of consumption, stomach cramping, severe diarrhea and vomiting afterwards. I will never come back to CPK again.spare yourself and go to PF Chang's or Redstone.",0

The rep told me he could not get a hold of the driver but also told me the driver left it with reception...problem is, we don't have a reception. Obviously, they left it at the wrong address, he said they'll try to fix it and if I don't get it tomorrow then ask Jeff Bezos at Amazon for a refund. Basically, AMAZON gives no Fs because the small business owner eats the mistakes of intelcom (no repercussions to their actions).

I wish Amazon would stop using this company. EVERY SINGLE time I have a delivery that comes through them they manage to screw it up. 

One job: take this box and take it to this address....written on this bright white-label in black ink.

During the heights of Covid in the masked-up 20s' Toronto housed housing insecure people in our neighborhood and unfortunately, there were some bad actors, and theft and other crimes skyrocketed in our area. Intelcom thought it was a good idea to leave all the packages in our insecure front foyer.  If they were nice enough to leave it at our doors as the job describes they never called up or knocked to let us know and so packages went missing.  It's just so frustrating to wait months for a package just to wait double for it.

One good thing was that it was finally early so if it had made it to me it would have really helped me out....so yay for ""if"".

We had a couple a beers at the funk zone and were walking buy and decided to stop by.
We ordered the tonkatsu ramen and pork bowl.

My review is based on comparing this ramen place to other Ramen places I have tried within the area.

The broth did not have much flavor pretty plain.
We decided to add an egg. It was cold.
No add on items provided or offered.

Pork bowl didn't have much flavor. Pork was really dry.

Service:
They smiled while helping us and taking our ordered. It wasn't super busy.
We asked for water 4x and never once received any. They kept saying it's on its way.

Then we sat another hour waiting to get check. Finally she printed it out gave her $50 and she disappeared for 49 min!! We thought she'd come back and sh started cleaning tables. Asked another waitress and she went to talk to her. After another 15 min she came back with our change of around $17. She thought we gave her a $17 tip. Um, no. The bill was $32.

4125616,1,"There is a reason why the reviews for this Springfield location are SO POOR and negative! Let me start off by saying the only reason why I even wanted to come here was because I was gifted a gift card. I think Hand & Stone and Joseph Anthony are 1000 times better than this astrocity poorly ran fake spa. 
I scheduled my appointment the first time and was never informed of a cancellation policy. I had to cancel because I didn't have anyone to watch my child and was told I would be charged if they couldn't fill the spot with another client. After stating this was never told to me she said ""she'll let it slide this time."" Oh gee thanks.
The second time I tried re schedule, it got cancelled 4 hours before my massage because the therapist apparently had a family emergency. 
The third time I scheduled I asked if I had to wear a mask for my service. I was told ""no, not if you're vaccinated."" Well great! Looks like I don't have to wear one then.
I walk in, get taken to the tranquility room and Nicholas comes out. He says ""are you Amanda?"" And I replied yes. He then says ""first and foremost before we get started you need a mask when you're in my room."" And I told him I was NEVER told that specific therapists had this policy, I was only told if I am vaccinated I don't need a mask. I tried to open the door to leave to go to the front desk and lobby area and he BLOCKED ME IN. I again tried to open the door and couldn't. I told him ""YOU NEED TO MOVE."" I almost reached in my purse for my pepper spray in case things got escalated I was very fearful in that instance. I am a small petite woman being locked in the room with the door blocked.
I get to the front desk and am told ""therapist are allowed to make their own policy for this."" WELL WHY WASNT I NOTIFIED?
Danielle, Rebecca, and their staff especially Nicholas are horrible and this business should not be running.
Massage Envy in Springfield is lucky this situation did not escalate. If you are a woman, BEWARE please! And if you are vaccinated do not bet on enjoying the fresh air!",0

4026191,1,"We came in wanting to support a local small business at after a trip to Sams Club. The place has limited seating. 

I couldn't tell is they were short staffed or if the server was new and not quite able to get her rhythm. When we entered the restaurant we weren't sure if we should seat ourselves or stand in line at the counter. There were a few patrons ahead standing near the counter. We were not acknowledged or greeted  when we walked in. 

Upon reaching the counter, we were told to take a seat. I counted a total of 5 tables including ours that was seated. 2 of them had already had there meal or at least waiting for the check. I watched as the server took the bill to one table, come over to our table and say that she would be right back ( we had already been waiting 10 min) then proceed to take coffee orders at the bar. Bring the check back to the other table. Then take an order for someone else. (They did come before us so no worries for that) what was completely unexceptionable was to see an older woman come from the back to serve food to another table not even acknowledge us or take our order and make small talk with the person she delivered the food to. Afterwards she went to another table and made small talk with them. By this time we were waiting for over 20 minutes. 

At this point we decided to leave and no gave a damn that we left either 

Seemed like a great place ... Clean.. nice decor... affordable prices but the service was not inviting at all. We totally did not feel welcomed.

I have worked as a restaurant server and am a good tipper (never less than 20% when I sit down and a server brings the food to the table) but I prefer the option and the amount I wish to give.

Our buying experience was through Tony Longo and it was a very good experience and went  down hill fast after that.  The financial dept. ran packages at us that we didn't want and or need, and only after when we got home did we see that the interest rate we got was out of the roof.
When we test drove the car it had some rattles and were informed it would be repaired while we did the paper work.  Soon after that we were told that they needed to order some parts and to bring it back for repairs on another day.
About a week later we returned for the repairs only to sit in the waiting room for 3 hours for the work to be done.  At that time the service manager said he had went to lunch and the paperwork got buried in other jobs on his desk and he only found it, and we were told that we still needed additional parts to repair the job and to come back at another time.
A few days later we returned to have this work done and we sat in the waiting room for 2 + hours. We were than told that we needed a new headliner and to set up a date that world take a day to repair. 
At that time as we were driving home we pulled into a rest area and phoned them to cancel the appointment and that we were not going to return and more.
This dealership is an hour+ drive from our home and the best way is to take the Pa. Turnpike at a cost of $6.00 one way. 
So as you see it was time and money that we lost and the repair job was never completed by this service dept.
My wife and I did than repair the issues for under $15.00 and less than 2 hours of work.

1859300,1,"Well.... let's start with the drinks;  the Old Fashioned-over-iced, no Luxardo cherry, and a huge orange slice to avoid the bourbon.  The Bloody Mary-none of the condiments that accompany the drink... no bacon, no veggies, minimal olives, and a few nuggets of pepper jack cheese.
Now for the food- frozen beef patty, lack of condiments on top with horrible flavor.  The pork and onion rings were ok.  Tempted to purge myself at the bathroom across the way. 

Now for the service---- what service???  Slow and painful.  I'd have better service in a crowded emergency room.

Imagine my disappointment when the food was just bland. I had the three-egg omelet with brisket, tomatoes, and spinach, which comes with toast and home fries. The omelet was just tasteless, nothing special, and the brisket (which the waitress had recommended as a guest favorite) was dry, stringy, and overcooked. I think my friend enjoyed her eggs benedict more, but the other two people agreed that the food was bland.

The service was fine. I didn't have poor service like many of the other reviews, but perhaps I was so focused on the ""meh""-ness of my food that I didn't notice the service.",0

TIP #1: make reservation in advance if you want to eat inside the restuarant. But you can't make reservations for the rooftop bar Pier Teaki. 
I made the mistake of making a reservation a week in advance, thinking it was for the rooftop bar Pier Teaki. But when we arrived, there is an employee at the bottom of the steps to check you in and said my reservation was for the indoor restuarant, not for the rooftop bar so I would be placed on the waiting list (over 1 hour wait during sunset time 8 PM). 

Inside the restuarant is beautiful. Grab a table by the window. We ordered the Mahi tacos and fish and chips. The Mahi was cold. But the rice was soggy and lacking flavor. It was actually funny to mess up something as simple as rice. But the waiter was nice enough to take it off our bill. The fish and chips weren't any better. The best part about the meal was the fries. The breading on the fish was too thick and overcooked. Captain Ds has better fish and chips and its a fast food chain. I'm glad we didn't order anything pricey on the menu otherwise we would have been even more disappointed. 

TIP #2: Just grab drinks at the rooftop bar for date night or girls night. 
I wouldn't come back for the food. Only for a special occasion to grab drinks and enjoy the view.",0

She came back less than two minutes later with waters and asked us again what we wanted to drink and eat. We ordered an appetizer and asked for additional time to look at the menu.

When she returned a couple minutes later I asked about a couple items on the menu, specifically, what one of their sauces tasted like. I asked if she could bring me just a taste of it. When she returned she informed me that the chef does not allow tastes, and I would need to order to find out what it tastes like. 

The drink menu is grossly overpriced. When I asked about their $10 margaritas she said they are ""good and normal sized"" whatever that means.

2957809,1,"I pride myself on being able to eat just about anything. I am a college student who, for the majority of the time, lives on garbage food. This is not to say I like garbage food, but rather it is what I am familiar with. Tonight, I decided to spend a little extra and treat myself. I found La Cocina on Yelp and the reviews were above average, and the photos of the food looked great. After my experience tonight, I decided there are some things I just won't eat. I want to be clear before launching into my description of how horrendous the food was: the service was decent. The food, on the other hand, sat under a heat lamp to the point where the lettuce was brown and gooey and everything else was baked to the crisp. I ordered the chile relleno and my roommate ordered the braised beef tacos. The salsa was tomato juice mixed with black pepper. The guacamole surely came from a bag, and the hot sauce was Tabasco mixed with vinegar. The rice was absolutely inedible to the point where it left an aftertaste so bad that it was reminiscent to eating a bar of soap. The meat in my roommate's tacos is best described as sandy leather. The beans had a thick crust due to the heat lamp and were spicy beyond words -- which is ironic, considering the salsa and the hot sauce were both tomato flavored water. Even the Coke was flat and was inexplicably warm despite the copious amount of ice used to water it down -- it defies science. The chile relleno was an over ripe poblano chile with no cheese to speak of and was coated in a thick crust of over crisp Panko bread crumbs. All told, we spent 40+ dollars on the most fundamentally disappointing dining experience I've had to date (remember, I pretty much eat garbage for a living so that's quite the testament to how inedible the food truly was). After careful deliberation, I've decided I would have rather lost my $40+ in a freak accident than pay for the unpleasant dining experience we just had. We left hungry.",0

Our server came  and got our drink orders and after dropping our drinks off did not come back for close to 10 minutes to take our order and then had the nerve to say are you ready to order? We each ordered a salad because we figured that wouldn't take too long, but we were mistaken. Another good 10 minutes went by and when we finally got our meal, I wished we would have stayed and waited it out at the first restaurant we went to. How hard is it to make a good salad? Apparently, pretty hard for Daddy Jacks. The lettuce had to be at least 2-3 days old.

3066097,2,"I wish I could give Bourbon House more stars. Situated where it is, it's prone to being a touristy place and there are indeed lots of tourists here. However, the food is above par. We had originally intended to sit at the oyster bar but there were too many of is (5) to be comfortable. We were seated in the dining room at a nice table, though in the middle of the room. We had 2 different servers. One was supposedly our drink server and the other for food. The drink server brought water and said she'd be back to take our drink order. She never came back. Instead, our food server arrived and told us about the specials (after stumbling a bit on what sauce came with which fish). Our friend, who is a regular, got it straight for her. She then left. She came back to take our food order and we told her we still hadn't ordered drinks. She took our order ""for her"" (our drink server). After what seemed like a really long time our drinks finally came. We then ordered some food. A couple dozen oysters and some other appetizers. We wanted to get a bottle of wine. We finally flagged down the drink server who took our order. Then we waited and waited and waited. Finally she showed up with an ice bucket for the wine, but no wine. She said her manager had to get the wine for her. I asked my friend if he'd ordered something expensive that was locked away, but in reality he'd ordered something from the low end of the list. I saw the server again standing around and I gave her a questioning look and pointed to the ice bucket. She kind of woke up and went to see if she could find our wine. It turns out it was sitting in the serving station waiting for her. However, I have to also fault the manager here because there was no notification to our server that the wine had been dropped off. This was indicative of the whole evening - communication seemed to not exist between the staff. Often our food server would glide by and not notice things that needed to be taken care of. When our wine was finally brought to the table we were already finished with our food. We had intended to order more food at that point but we were really annoyed by the length of time it took to get the wine. The server offered to remove it from our bill?!? I would hope so. It never was opened. She didn't seem to understand the issue. I then told her I'd like to talk to the manager. He didn't seem to understand the issue either. Our food server came back by and had no idea anything was amiss. After we told her a bit or what had happened and she said she was sorry, yet walked away not noticing 5 empty water glasses and an empty bottle of water on the table. Don't these people talk to each other? They ended up offering us complimentary dessert which we accepted, only because we were still hungry and didn't want to go somewhere else and start over. I have to say the desserts were very good, especially the Bourbon Soaked Corn Cake with Steen's Syrup and Creme Anglaise. 5 stars by iteself.  But then even when the check came we waited at least 10 minutes and then finally had to flag someone down to take our credit card. I think we could have left and no one would have noticed.
I know restaurants have off nights, but I can only review what I experienced. As I stated earlier, I hate to only give 2 stars, but based on the service alone I would have given 1. We witnessed (and overheard) another table just get up and leave after their guests arrived. ""We're not staying. We need to go somewhere where we can get served."" There's an earlier review from someone who had a dirty oyster. I will say that ours were the cleanest I've ever had. I would have given at least 4 stars if I was reviewing just the food.

If you want a coaster or a T shirt of the show then by all means visit there but if you're hoping for that cool sign Mike grabbed in that one episode, don't bother.",0
1351719,1,"I have gotten service done on my car at this Firestone before and did not have any problems.  This changed last week when I took my car in for a routine oil change and had several problems. As a result I will not be returning. First, when I came in for my appointment I was told it would take about 45 minutes (which already is longer than most places take for an oil change) I said no problem I would wait. The work on my car took double that amount of time and I was given no explanation. In fact, while I waited I watched as they checked many people out and gave each person a detailed break down of their service and bill. I am a 23-year-old female and cannot help but feel I was treated differently because of my age and gender.  When I was checking out I was asked to sign a piece of paper, pay my bill, and handed my keys. I was given no review of what work had been done on my car, no thank you come again, nothing. 

The next day I was concerned by the noise I heard while driving on the highway. I got home and saw a pretty sizable oil leak in my garage and I checked underneath my car and found that the drip plate/shield was completely hanging down and had been dragging as I drove. I called Firestone and they told me my car would need to be towed and gave me a phone number. I called the towing company and was told someone would be to me within an hour. Over an hour and a half later I called again and they told me it would be another hour. Firestone then sent someone out to secure underneath my car so that I could drive in for service. The man who came out  informed me that the plate/shield had been secured with zip ties rather than the screws/bolts and the ties had come undone while I drove. I explained this to the person at the front desk and was told that they were unaware of this and should have been told by the person that serviced my car. After waiting 2 hours for my drip plate to be cleaned and secured I was told that my car came in with no bolts and the plate was zip tied. Seeing as the dealership was the last place to work on my car I feel confident that is not true. Regardless, I was again given minimal explanation at checkout. When I inquired about replacing the bolts since the zip ties broke in less than 24 hours I was told they would have to be ordered and that I would need to come in again.  For the second time I was given no detailed explanation and no apology for the 2 hours I spent waiting for the mistake to be fixed.  

The bolts took two days to come in and I had to call to check on them. I came in a third time for the replacements and AGAIN was not given any explanation or apology. After waiting another 50 minutes I was handed my keys without a word for the THIRD time.  I spent almost 5 hours at firestone in a one-week period and was never once given an explanation about why the work was not done properly the first time or an apology for the inconvenience.  I cannot help but feel my age and gender influenced this lack of customer service and treatment.  As someone who paid full price for a synthetic oil change that took 3 visits to complete I would have at least appreciated a simple apology or explanation.",0
5864473,1,"GA-ROSSSSSS!!!  I ordered ONE blueberry pancake and scrapple.  The lovely waitress instead brought me FIVE blueberry pancakes and told me ""You can just take the rest to go, hon....""  Thanks!   (Who takes leftover pancakes home? I don't!)  Looking for fresh blueberries?  Keep looking.  These were the WORST pancakes ever.  They drop globs of blueberry mush into the pancake batter and serve em up...so gross.  And the scrapple was about 2 inches thick and cooked in the FRYER.  I politely sent it back.

Immediately called the restaurant to ask about other parking options and got hung up on by the person we spoke to bc he could not be bothered. Got inside and seated, only to be ignored for over 10 minutes (no water, no  ""hey, we're backed up/short staffed and will be with you in a minute""). AND the server who took us to our table was so rude and seemed annoyed. Not interested in trying this place ever again.

Perfect for a small child to be electrocuted with a piece of silverware.  The worst part of the experience was to find out that they did not accept the $10 restaurant.com certificate that I purchased the same day online, meaning that they allowed their business to be featured on the website for purchase and then would not honor it when I presented it.  I'll never be back, ever.",0

6924800,2,"Unfortunately, I have to give Valenzano two stars, the one as a minimum and another for ease of my initial wine tasting reservation. I made a reservation two and half weeks in advance to do a wine tasting for 8 people as a part of a bachelorette party. I have to say, that process was simple as could be. I was excited because it looks beautiful and the bride-to-be absolutely loves the wine. 

A week later, they called to relay that they needed to cancel or reschedule the reservation because they booked a private party. I just don't think it is great business to double book when a reservation is already made. The best they could do is offer a wine tasting that day hours earlier without the included cheese sampling because the kitchen would be reserved for the private party they double booked me with. I can't imagine setting aside cheeses is hard. It was disappointing to know they wouldn't even accommodate such a simple part of what they originally promised. 


Posting a review to warn others that your reservation isn't set in stone no matter how far in advance you plan. If it's for a special event that doesn't involve booking the entire place, I'd pick somewhere else.",0

1307198,2,"We went to this place for several times during last couple years.  Food was always reasonable.  Not the best but good.  Good enough for 4 stars.  On July 6th, after it reopened, we decided to order take out for our visiting grandkids.  We ordered adult salmon with mash potatoes and 2 kids (salmon and ribs).  Big mistake.  Salmon turned out to be very dry and very well could be reheated leftover from previous day.  But at least it can be eaten.  Ribs were a disaster.  It was a mess.  Meat was completely burned down.  I really meant BURNED.  One cannot give it to dog burned.  We called and complained.  They refunded us for kids ribs.  Make long story short, if you order to go - make sure that it is what you want, not what they want to give you.  I think 1 and 1/2 stars for this meal.  I am not sure that I will be going there for while.",0
6376862,2,"I normally perform all of my beauty rituals at home by myself, but this New Year's Eve we had a guest staying at our place, so I decided to leave the house for a leg and underarm wax. 

I came in early in the afternoon of the 31st, and told them what I wanted. At first the woman told me $8 for underarms, then someone else (the owner, I suppose) glanced sideways at me and corrected her, saying it was $15, plus another $30 for a half-leg. I was going to use them regardless of their prices, but I thought the rate change was a bit suspicious. 

I set an appointment for 3:30. When I checked in at 3:25, the woman who would be waxing me said it would be another five minutes. I went and sat down, and watched her start on a manicure, which took a full 20 minutes. Seriously?

The wax was slow, but virtually pain free, which I was happy with at the time. It wasn't until I came home that I noticed entire patches of hair had been missed and my legs were extremely irritated as they have never been before, to the point where shaving would have made it worse. I had to wear opaque tights that night to cover them up. The next day, I already had stubble, making it apparent that the waxer had simply broken the hair rather than tearing it out at the roots, which also explained why I had experienced relatively little pain. 

Honestly, if the wax had been any good, I wouldn't have cared that the room I was in looked like a back alley abortion clinic, or that the flimsy curtain intended to ensure my privacy wouldn't stay closed.

The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is that this is primarily a nail place, and maybe they're good for that. In any case I'm not coming back for any more services.",0
3368424,1,"I had a terrible experience with this company. Went there a total of 4 times in a week, the last time to get my money back for a battery that did not work. After the frustration of NOT getting my phone fixed, they couldn't even honor their 90 day warranty on batteries without corporate approval. Wish I had never gone there.
The battery on my iPhone 5 had lost its ability to keep a charge. It would charge, just not able to make it a full day without a recharge. 
So, I took it to iHospital, left the phone with them to replace the battery which took about an hour. Took the phone home but the battery would not charge at all.  Tried several different cords and outlets, no luck. Took my phone back the next day, they said they removed the battery and tested it, and it took a charge.  Said my phone needed an iOS update. Took phone back home, ran backup and completed update. Battery still not taking a charge. So, took back to iHospital, they said it needed to be reset to factory defaults. Ok, this was starting to get really annoying and time consuming. So, back home to reset. Still not charging. Called iHospital, no answer, left message.  No one returned my call, ever...
At this point I have a iPhone with very little charge left and no way to charge it. So, I took my phone to LifeLine in Green Hills.  Right away it was a very different experience. He diagnosed it as a bad battery, unfortunately he did not have a replacement in stock and at this point, I was so frustrated by the whole ""repair"" experience that I decided it was best to just get a new phone. If I had gone to LifeLine in the first place, I would likely have a functioning phone for around $60, instead of shelling out $$$ for a new phone that I did not want or need.",0

The 25th month, they were rude but charged us 10% more $2200 a month, we were suppose to close on sept 27th but the hurricane evacuation held up builders and the permits were late, we didn't find out about the delay until October 1st. My husband went in to speak to Susan, and she told him that he had to get out, the owner wanted the house back. We are both in our 60's, so we moved out the next morning, into storage containers, had the house professionally cleaned, the garage and lanai professionally power washed, stayed in a hotel the night of the 3Rd, moved into an Airbnb for two weeks until our house is ready. 
Then, Susan sent us a $250.00 'late fee' and told us we had to pay for the days we were in the house. Nasty emails from her, telling us we were lucky the owner allowed us to stay in the house the extra month, she said he didn't charge us an up charge for going month to month , we sent her our bank statement that clearly showed us paying the 10% more for September. 
You could never get them on the phone, the rude, unprofessional emails and in person were not acceptable in any business. We just got another email stating we owed $2200.00 for October and a late fee. Good luck
The house was dirty when we moved in, the ice maker didn't work, the 'spa like rock water fountain' didn't work, we were told to use ice trays, for a $2000 a month rental home ,, were told it had a washer and dryer, owner sold it, so we had to buy them, they left personal clothing, and other things and the house was so dirty,,,

3226941,1,"This has got to be a contender for worst McDonald's in the city. I feel bad for the employees working here as most of them really do try hard, but this location is so understaffed. There are three registers at the front to take orders, but I have never seen more than one manned regardless of how long the line gets (it's also worth noting this location still does not have automated order kiosks, so your only option is a register). Even then that lone register is empty the majority of the time, as the one front counter employee is busy putting together the last order received. My last few wait times: 14min for a medium fries, 16min for McNuggets, 18min for a McDouble and small fries, 26min (!) for a sundae. Not good, especially as the number of people ahead of me ranged from 0-4 for these orders. The understaffed and rushed nature also leads to the people in the back making mistakes and the food not being right/good quite often. The drive-thru isn't much better as the order is typically slow to come out so they'll tell you to pull forward to wait, despite there not being an actual spot to do so. What results is trying to awkwardly position your vehicle so as not to block any people trying to exit behind you, while still trying to leave yourself a way to backup and leave should there still be a vehicle behind you at the window. Lastly, this location is a major hangout for street people and like it or not, that brings many issues. People aggressively panhandling in the store, obviously intoxicated people ranting at customers and sometimes threatening them, people dealing and/or doing drugs (avoid the bathrooms), etc. It gets especially bad late at night. Most 24hr locations close the inside part late at night and just run the drive-thru in order to avoid such issues, but this location has brilliantly decided to do the opposite and closes the drive-thru at night forcing you to run the gauntlet of sketchiness if you want anything. The staff completely ignore these people and any issues they might be causing, although I can't say I blame them given the circumstances. I worry about the safety of some of these kids working the front counter alone late at night.",0
1387139,1,"I've shopped at all Simply Chic locations for over 9 years. I've been a loyal customer, purchased several luxury designer items, and sold designer items to all locations. As of today, I will no longer shop at ANY locations ever again. I've contacted the Plainfield store to purchase the Louis Vuitton Neo Shoulder Bag. I've called and spoke with one of your associates to purchase the bag over the phone, due to my location. I'm aware you hold luxury items for only TWO hours. The associate indicated that they are uncomfortable taking such a large amount over the phone. Shortly after, the store associate asked Andrea, the manager, if I can place a deposit at least. She said they will take a deposit of $100, hold the bag until tomorrow, and I gave her my card information. Andrea called me at 2:56 pm, and stated that she spoke with Andy. He requested I purchase the bag over the phone, which is what I intentionally was doing in the first place. She indicated that its best for ME to see the bag in person, because of the high amount, return policy, and to see the condition. She reinstated that the bag will be held until tomorrow. ( I do not live in Plainfield, which is why I preferred to pick up the bag today). I received a text at 9:59am the following morning, indicating the bag was sold LAST NIGHT?? I also noticed on Instagram that the bag sold at 6:00pm (7.7.20) the same evening I called. You should've notified me or at least have the courtesy to contact me prior to selling. The fact that I was lied too, appalls me. You had no intention of notifying me. I've spoken to other customers, that shop at your stores in the past, that ""state you treat minorities completely different"".

666530,2,"To start with, y'all better have reservations, because there's a dude at the door literally pacing and dying to tell you about the wait.

I'm pretty sure the reason for the wait is 1) because he says so and 2) it's a tourist trap. 

I knew going in that the food was going to be touristy fare. Not great, not terrible. One eats here for the experience, not the cuisine. Right? 

Hooooooo boy. That guy mad about me not having reservations? I had to ask if there was a bar. He pointed to a seat next to the service area. Which is where I sat. There were other seats, two -tops with a counter, FACING A MIRROR, back to the bar. In fairness these were marked reserved for COVID restrictions, which, haha, like that would make a difference. Anyone and everyone is all welcome, don't mess with mask. 

The bartender was pretty cool. He plainly lacked support but gosh dang, he was killing it. He and one other staff handled the bar, which means drinks and food for the bar, drinks for the restaurant, and general okay-ness. I think he did okay! 

The food: DO NOT ORDER OYSTERS HERE. Oh my gosh. I'm still hoping I don't end up hospitalized. The poor things were plainly prepped early and stuffed in a walk-in. How do I know? the horseradish was brown (oxidized) and the cocktail sauce had a skin on it. Like pudding you didn't cool correctly. Ugh. The texture of the oysters was another point of concern. They were not cut from the shell. The texture was literally mucus-like. How are they proud to serve this?

The sea bass was outstanding. By that, I mean they didn't fuck it up, because sea bass is pretty amazing as it is. It came with rice, which you can ignore, and green beans which are also as good as sea bass. 

I ordered a shrimp po'boy for take out, as I have a train ride tomorrow and don't wish to deal with the surly dude tossing out nuked hot dogs. The selection was my fault and I will not review the sandwich.",0
6161023,2,"For routine pet care such as vaccinations, I think the clinic works like most.  

For emergency care and clear veterinary medicine advice, I did not think they gave caring or competent care.  I awoke to find my 11-year old collie unable to walk and bleeding above her right elbow.  Upon arrival, they put her on oxygen and fluids...after I signed I would cover costs.  The vet initially diagnosed her with a snake bite.  I expressed concern since she had been bitten in 2009 and I understood then that anti-venom would not be as effective again.  Had we not been waiting for the out of town records, she would have been administered anti-venom.  Once the records arrived, the vet said she thought it was valley fever...until she realized my collie had not been in a Tucson long.  Finally, the vet settled on telling me that my collie's condition was in the ""realm of the unusual.""  She also knew my elderly collie was in pain, had a debilitating wound of unknown origin, had an infection and was unable to walk.  She said we'd have to move my collie to a different clinic that could test her blood clotting because her wound continued bleeding. I asked about what to expect yet she she would not make any type of diagnosis without blood clotting tests.  I knew the outlook was grim but she would not discuss prognosis.  Before leaving, I expressed I wanted to wait for my husband who was in Phoenix and had a bigger vehicle.  I was concerned with transporting my 100 pound collie AGAIN in the front seat of my Fiat for blood clotting tests. The staff chastised me by stating her condition was critical and they said they sent her records already.  The records themselves were full of inaccuracies including her diagnosis (snake bite), dates and the side of her injury. As we lifted her into the car wrapped in the same sheet I brought her, I realized the sheet was cold and wet--urine-soaked.  I was furious.  The care provided was $600 and I left with a dog in pain with no diagnosis and wrapped in her urine.  I took her to the Veterinary Specialty Center of Tucson as recommended and it was the absolute best thing Northwest Pet Clinic offered -- not because they did blood clotting tests which would not have led to her recovery or alleviated her pain. Her age, wound, pain and inability to walk were not in the ""realm of the unusual.""  We could have pursued aggressive treatment for her wound and hoped for some recovery but she was in significant pain and would require extended hospitalization and even then the prognosis was poor.  Either Northwest was not competent enough to provide such an assessment based on my collie's condition or they refused to address the reality of her condition to provide unwarranted treatment. They also had NOT sent the records as they claimed. We let our collie go and it was unfortunate that we had to experience the added drama of the back/forth of her diagnosis and he physical transfer.  I would never recommend taking a pet in distress to Northwest.  I would take their recommendation, however, and always take my pet to the Veterinary Specialty Center of Tucson.",0

3930984,1,"Me and three buddies drove across town to check this place out.  When we walked in, there was a man and woman behind the counter going back and forth over something, just talking amongst themselves. Neither one greeted us with a hello or even a nod of the head. 
     The setup is: you look at an overhead menu like a fast food restaurant. You order at the counter and pay before you get your meal.   I f#cking hate restaurants like this. 
     I'll tell you why:  If you have never been there before it takes a while to figure out what I want. With four guys at the counter, it can take forever.   
     Now how about the people that come in after us who have to wait for the four guys in front who don't know what they want to order?  If it was me waiting behind others I'd be irate. 
     When I go to a cafe, I want to sit, relax, look at a menu, converse with my buddies, discuss what we want to order and slowly decide.  Not feel pressured to hurry up and order because others are waiting.  How do I know if I want dessert?  So I have to order that too or go back and pay again?  And how does one tip in a place like this?  15-20%?  No way, not when I order my food like a fast-food restaurant.  And what about my drink?  When my beverage is empty do I have to go back up to the counter and beg for more?  Do I pay more? How does this work?
     Perhaps if the lady and man behind the counter weren't so busy talking amongst themselves and had been more inviting we would have stayed.  
     Quite honestly, we didn't even try the food. Maybe it's good, who the hell knows? Not us. I was standing there smack in front of the two of them waiting to be acknowledged.  We turned to walk out at which point she sarcastically yells, ""Thank you!""    
     Thank you?  Did you really scream that in that tone?  As if they were insulted that we walked out. 
     What kind of ""French themed"" cafe makes you stand in line?
     When this was the Checkerboard Cafe it was packed, you could hardly find a seat.  When we walked in this morning it was empty except for one table.  But they were far too busy to greet us. At least say hello, go over the menu with us, say F#CKING HELLO.

The only thing French about this restaurant is the attitude.",0

1530616,1,"Forget about the location and the amenities included, because there is a lot of negative baggage that comes along with this place. ZRS management taking over has been a nightmare for everyone. Taking away certain amenities that past management included, tagging on extra unnecessary charges when you're trying to move out, and overall just having a nasty attitude towards their residents. It is a money pit when it comes to trying to move out. The most unprofessional, unqualified, and unhelpful management that I've ever dealt with. They don't answer their phones, don't respond to voicemails, and basically work against you to squeeze every last dollar out of you possible. READ THE FINE PRINT, because they have a lot of tricks up their sleeve to get you to disregard certain things within the lease agreement. Oh yeah, and don't forget to reread your lease every single month this way you don't miss out on ZRS's next scam. Avoid at all costs, there are plenty of other nice and affordable places that you will find. I see a group of people moving out every single day, and yet haven't noticed anyone moving in for the last 3 weeks. They're losing units and they're desperate, do not fall for it!",0

When I signed up they explained someone would come out and evaluate my lawn by walking it and doing a soil test. This was to ensure they used the appropriate mixtures, etc. my primary concern was weeds. Long story short, they never inspected my lawn and didn't treat for my primary concern which was weeds. THEN they try to charge me over $50 over the agreed price saying they treated for bugs after they inspected my yard, which they didn't even look at the lawn. 

Today I get a call from a salesperson (Chris) saying that when they treated last time that the technician noticed a significant bug problem in my landscaping and they would keep spreading and destroy all of my landscaping if we didn't set up a series of treatment for them. One small problem, I DON'T HAVE ANY LANDSCAPING!!

After finishing our mediocre entrees, we had to split the table's tab onto two cards and was told it wouldn't be possible by the server.

When we approached the manager (Michael Juan) about our card that was not returned, he was incredibly rude and unhelpful. 

We finally got all of our party's cards back and were able to leave, but it was obvious the general manager didn't care at all about our situation.

4560291,1,"First, I'll say that I am a fan of the ribs served at the FnS in Troy. While it is nice to have a new (non-franchise chain) restaurant in Wood River, I don't think the food quality carried over to the Wood River location.

The ribs are average and the ones sold at Dierberg's under the Bob's banner are better tasting. The fried potato twisters are a novel idea but just flavorless puffy fries. The potato salad and cole slaw are prepared with what seems to be mayonnaise, but they also lack the mayo flavor and are just bland. I tried the sweet potato casserole with high hopes and it was covered in marshmallows and apple filling and just tasted like sugar. My overall impression after two visits was disappointing.

The Wood River location is in a nondescript​ former KFC location that also housed a failed restaurant prior to being changed into the FnS. I almost drove past it because the easily readable signage says Frozen Custard in big red letters. They use a cluttered and hard to read logo on their signage as many businesses do. It looks nice on the menu andwebsite​e but does not translate to an​ easy to read street facing sign.

When you entry the building there is no visible menu board. You have to wait until you get to the register to actually see the menu board. This slows down the ordering process and makes for long lines. They have added some laminated menus but they are located by the registers so they really don't help the situation. There is a full wood rack that (I guess) serves as a line direction barrier, but in reality, it just takes up space. It would be nice to see a stand with menus you could look at while in line, or for them to install another menu board.

The drive thru is poorly defined and customers park in the drive through lane making it almost impossible to exit to the roadway behind the business or circle around to use the front exit",0

3406494,2,"We went to the Bourbon House for oysters and drinks. Our initial impression was good as the atmosphere was nice and the staff seemed friendly. The guy who took our drink order was clearly new, which in itself isn't bad, but when ""Bourbon"" is supposedly your specialty, then the people who work there should have a basic knowledge of it. The oysters were fresh, but fairly dirty, however the drinks were good. The real problems started when we ordered a final drink which was a High West Barreled Manhattan as a 1 ounce pour. The server was a little confused at the request, but we showed him the selection in the menu. When he returned it was with a full sized mixed drink, which was in fact a Manhattan, but not what was ordered. He informed us that the product we ordered was not available in a one ounce pour regardless of what it said on the drink menu (keep in mind that we are well aware of what the product is and it certainly can be poured as 1 ounce since it is a pre-bottled cocktail). Oh well, the drink was still good and we were enjoying ourselves....... until the check came. First thing we noticed was that we were charged for an additional 1/2 dozen oysters we didn't order. When mentioned to the server the response was ""oh, OK"" and he went back and fixed it. There was no apology,  just a look of someone who tried to take advantage of us and wasn't successful.  The second issue was the charge for the last drink we had ordered (the one that was supposed to be a $6 one ounce pour). We had been charged $15! Even though their standard mixed drink price was $12  In bringing up our concern, we were given a long explaination about how its due to a different process they have there in the back with how they store and handle the alcohol, which is again completely false information since they litterally just have to pour the drink from a bottle. Through all of this, there was no actual accountability, no real effort to make it right, and frankly reeks of a systemic system in place to take advantage of potentially naive customers.",0

Unfortunately,  it went downhill from there.  It literally took 41 minutes  (I timed it) to get our food!  We began to get a little agitated when the people who came in after us were served while we sat there.  

We were seated at a table right in the front by the hostess station.  The manager hung out there.  You would have thought someone (especially our server) would have noticed.  Our thoughts were that our order wasn't placed.  That's okay...mistakes happen.  An acknowledgement of a mistake would have gone a long way. 

However,  when we got our food we realized it had been ready -for quite a while it would seem.  It was lukewarm at best.   My husband had ordered eggs over medium & he they came with the tops crispy & the eggs were almost hard.

The review of the food is probably not a good representative of what it should have  tasted like.  Hot food simply tastes better.

There was nothing on our plates that I can say was good warm.  It might have been good hot.  I think the French Toast might have been good -  hard to tell.

Why didn't we send it back?   Because we had been sitting there for 45 minutes!   We simply wanted to leave by then.  

Too bad.....I really wanted to like this place.  But since no one even acknowledged the mistake.....we will never know if it was good. 

Note to OINK..... good food means nothing without good service.",0

5907671,2,"I have USAA as my auto insurer and they recommended this shop. So, I Dropped my Mazda off to this shop on  August 2nd to get some work done after a vehicle did damage to mine. Around a month later, I received my vehicle back from the shop. Upon my own inspection, I noticed that a majority of the work was done well. However, there was a whole panel of my car that was clearly untouched on the exterior with a lot of damage done from the vehicle that hit me. In addition to this, there was electrical work that wasn't done correctly. My power lock and windows all worked correctly upon dropping my vehicle off. After being repaired, my power lock and power window function did not work on my front passenger side. I also noted that a noise that I mentioned to the tech was still occurring, and my front bumper was not properly secured (parts were sticking out where pieces of the bumper meet).

I dropped my vehicle off once again after mentioning these things to someone at the shop and they apologized and said that none of this should have happened.

I picked my vehicle up around 2 weeks later and :

- The power window on my front passenger side still doesn't work and I was told that a part just went bad and I'd have to pay for it to be repaired.
- the bumper is still not correct, parts are still sticking out
- the noise I can hear dealing with one of my tires is still present

Pros: friendly staff, provided a rental for me
Cons: wait time, they'd tell me a date my car would be ready and it wouldn't be ready for days past the date, a lot of the issues are still present

I picked my car up the last time in a hurry because I was supposed to move States, 14 hours away the last week my car was in the shop, and with this said, I didn't have another two weeks to put my car back in the shop to fix any of this mentioned above. 

Disappointed with the service.",0
3173451,2,"Hailey's has a great inventory of almost every type of salvaged building material you may want, but their prices are likely the reason I have watched some of my favorite pieces sit there year after year. Nothing is marked with a price, so there is the potential to negotiate. Whenever I found something I liked, the price would be insanely high, so a negotiation was pointless. For example, $150 for a single, craftsman-type column that needed considerable repair due to wood rot. Or $175 for a simple door (no carvings or detail work) that was missing its glass and also had some rot. Maybe I'm just cheap or have different expectations for the price structure at a salvage yard, but the prices here don't really make it a good value for what you're getting. If pricing weren't an issue, I'd give this place 5 stars.",0

We came on the weekend at dinner time. The night before was the besties bachelorette party so we were hungover and hungry. And we left that way. 

Our server was poor. The grill was too hot so everything was cooking too quickly. Our fried rice which we paid extra for was mush. Fried rice is supposed to be made with cold rice and this wasn't. Our steak was over cooked. We literally had to ask for it to be removed or it would have been rubber. And the salt.....OMG you would have thought we ordered a side of high blood pressure. The portion sizes were small. Normally at dinner you get enough food to feast on for the next day. This was anything but. It was barely a lunch portion.

My husband ordered a half dozen oysters vinet. There were 2 things I immediately noticed. First of all there were only 5 oysters on the plate. Secondly, they were about the size of a nickel! Literally, they were that tiny. I am from New Orleans. I've seen lots of oysters in my life. Never have I seen oysters so tiny! The chef should be arrested for serving something like that. Look, if the product is not quality, don't serve it that day. Period. Two people at my table ordered red beans and rice. They both complained of how sweet the beans were. Red beans only need a little sugar. These beans eliminated the need for dessert! I order fried shrimp. They looked beautiful on the plate but were not seasoned at all. Very bland. I might give this place another try so I can taste some other items on the menu but what we all ordered today was very basic. If they can't get that right I don't have much hope for this place.

There was a standard breakfast for all guests in the small dining area.  There isn't really a lobby to speak of, but they do have a limited selection of pop and candy for sale.  You will need to keep your key card with you at all times as all main doors are locked 24/7.

The pull out couch was very flimsy, but our kids were OK on it.  They have a new TV system so you need 1 remote for the TV channels and 1 for volume control - pretty tacky.

It's a restaurant. People do this every day. I can't fathom why Red's can't figure this out after being open for close to a year. Sort it out, people.  There's no excuse.

1831512,1,"This is not directed towards Dr. Mitchell, who seems like a very proficient and caring optometrist. Rather, it is geared towards the optical department personnel. 

I purchased some very pricey lenses from this place. They were Essilor Varilux Physio Enhanced 1.74 with Crizal anti-reflective coating. They were about $600 ... for lenses only. Within a few months, the lenses developed scratches and swirls. The anti-reflective coating was supposedly the issue. They were replaced under warranty. Second pair were fine for a few weeks and then started having the same issues.Since I am primarily a contact lens  wearer, I wear my glasses only in the evening for about 3-4 hours. I decided not to bother. A few months went by and by now they were out of warranty. Fast forward about 2 years to the present. 

Today I contacted them and spoke with an optician at this place. I wasn't calling to complain but mentioned that I did not want to order the same lenses and tried to understand whether I should expect the same thing again. What followed was pretty shocking. At first she said I had probably left them in the heat. I told her that these were being worn in the evening at home. Then she said that they were probably in a very humid environment. I live in one of the driest places on the planet. Next she suggested that they may have been lying under my bed on the floor. I asked her if she was joking and she didn't respond to that. Then she asked me if they were being stored in a case. I said they were typically on the nightstand next to my bed. She said they should always be in a case and that is most likely I was having problems. There was an undeniable tone of hostility in her voice. I repeated that I wasn't asking for a replacement but I didn't want to have the same issues again. At that point she disconnected me .... end of story!

The nurse practitioners joy Felton came into the room in front of my child and began chastising me and telling me I wouldn't be rude to her staff when they were standing in the same room and both were rude to me I was shaking from hypoglycemia and ask her to please see if they can hurry and the NPR didn't care she wanted someone to yell at and act like I have to listen to her crap! It's not right that she did that in front of people and i will never come back to this shit hole again! She even told me that it better be crystal clear! I said can we just move on in a professional manner here and see my patient without being attacking me! She said as long as we are CrystaL clear! I am apauld!!",0
6515138,2,"We decided to stop by for a Saturday lunch.  We were quickly greeted and seated.

We ordered the Club Royale and the Rotisseries Style Gyro.  Most dishes come with a choice of homemade soups and we opted for the Chicken and Dumplings and it was delicious!

The Gyro was an ample portion and quite tasty.  The Club Royal was not up to their standard.  It was dry and meager (see pic).  The Club does come with fries however, mine were a little tardy.  I cannot recommend the Club Royal.  

The service was speedy and friendly.",0
3509511,2,"If I were reviewing based on food alone, it would be 3 stars.  If I were reviewing based solely on service and experience, it would be 1 star.  Thus, a 2.

First, the food.  It was good.  We had the aranchini, which we all enjoyed.  Then I had the veal piccata.  It was good, but dare I say Lorenzo's does it better.  My mom had their squid entree (squid in red sauce) put over some pasta (which they gladly did for her) and it was tops!  I honestly don't remember what my dad had.  Something veal-y, methinks.  I know he enjoyed it either way.  

Now onto the weirdness.  So it's in a strip-mall.  So what?  I hate strip malls as much as the next person, but it's not apparent when you're inside.  What *is* apparent is the LOUD music and the club vibe.  Sure the music was something instrumental and nondescript, but turn that shizz down!  And then... I couldn't even believe it when I looked up and saw the recessed lighting in the ceiling that changes colors.  Gross!  It's just bad taste.  Like identity-crisis bad taste.  Or Real-Housewives-of-New-Jersey bad taste.  I'm sure someone thought they were pretty clever with that lighting, too.  Shame.

But here is the ultimate weirdness:  our waiter.  Dude would not let it rest.  Please stop asking me what I'm looking for and give me a minute with the wine list.  I don't know what I'm looking for necessarily until I see what you have.  And if you are in such a state about being able to answer questions about a wine, you're gonna have to give me more than, ""Well, I don't really like Chiantis"" when I ask you about one!  Personal preference aside, it is your job to explain the menu to us.  We ended up getting a Shiraz because our waiter *wouldn't LET UP* about it.  When I'd asked him to explain why it was so good, all he could tell me was that it was really ""different"" and the best he'd ever had. Again, give me some damn descriptors!

OK, so the wine was good.  But he buffaloed us into the aranchini (thought we'd wanted the artichoke hearts initially) because they were the house specialty, blah, blah, blah.  Fine.  They were fine.  But calm down.  Overall, the waiter was far too overbearing, to the point of being a little bit outta his head (he had a moment of ""vision"" in which he was examining the wine bottle on a purely sensory level... woah, it's so ""heavy""....  I'm not kidding).  Strange.  Like, ""hopped up"" strange.

Oh!  One more weird thing I almost forgot!  They bring the specials around on a tray, which I found a big turn-off as saran-wrapped raw salmon or scallops or whatever doesn't really float my boat.  Look, I've been to Al's and if you're gonna bring some fresh cuts of steak out to me, well alright then!  It works!  Because I am buying it for the cut, for the meat.  But when you present me with a cling-wrapped piece of salmon that will be prepared with a bunch of other stuff... what's the point?  We've all seen salmon before.  Weird.

To sum it up, the food was good, but the atmosphere and the waiter were perplexing!  Probably wouldn't go back.",0
2668821,1,"I would give this place no stars if I had the option.  I ordered a Margarona and they gave me a margarita separate from the corona because they didn't have the little bottles or the attachment. Had I know they would come separate I would have ordered a different drink. My Chile relleno tasted horrible like cleaning supplies and when I mentioned my concerns to the server he said he would send the manager. The manager came and completely dismissed me and my concerns. The waiter ditched out and sent someone else to ""deal"" with me. There was no effort to make any of this right. Upon paying the girls at the front asked how everything was and when I was honest and showed my disappointment and they blatantly rolled their eyes at me. They obviously don't take customer service seriously at this restaurant and have lost a customer for it. I'm really bummed and disappointed because this was my favorite Mexican place in the area. I'm a Chile Relleno connoisseur and theirs failed miserably. I will never take my family here again.",0
995813,2,"The short and sweet: very unimaginative sushi roll menu plagued by inexpensive options that are small in size. 

The prices look nice on the menu, but I'd rather pay the usual $11-13 for a specialty roll and have it come out in 8-10 fully loaded pieces than pay $8 for a roll with 6 pieces. It's not that the 6 piece rolls are cut thicker, either, they're just plain small. Could be that I'm just spoiled with some other great sushi roll (I'm reviewing this based on rolls, not nigiri, sashimi or fusion) restaurants in Tampa, because I had a hard time finding a couple of rolls to select that sounded tasty. There's little creativity involved with their specialty rolls. As for the taste...meh. It's sushi, so it's going to taste pretty good so long as it isn't rotten, but I wasn't a fan of the enormous cucumber wedges that took up 50% of the roll. The conch did not have a desirable texture/consistency to it. It's normally lightly chewy, almost like calamari. This conch had the consistency of a raw potato or something. Service was great and it's a beautiful restaurant. I enjoyed my green mussels appetizer, but I probably won't come back to eat sushi rolls. 2.5/5.",0

The lady he was working with, she is a total waste of time whoever hired her. she literally took her sweet time no matter how long that line got. And it seems the longer it got slower she got. The poor guy try to do everything. 
As for the quality they are charging $10 for avocado on toast! Are you all out of your minds!! I know it's the airport but that kind of gouging truly needs to be illegal. This needs to be shut down, now I see why there's a Starbucks on every corner at least they know how to get it right.",0

1386670,1,"I hate giving bad reviews but I'm giving this complex zero stars. Initially office staff very accommodating they assisted me with getting an apt while enroute  from Everett WA to Boise. They are nice people and complex is beautiful but you can see by my photos the absolute mess I have on my patio. This is the 3rd time my patio has flooded and this last time it flooded into my living room. They brought towels to help stop the water from coming any further into my apt. But since then.....nothing!!!  They never picked up wet towels like they said they would and have left several messages with no return call. This is what Im looking at every day this summer. Went into office a couple days ago and asked to move to new apt was told I had to wait 6 months!! What?? Every time it rains I have to worry about flooding??

4495090,2,"The only reason I ever come to this place at all is its proximity to my dorm and its prime spot as a late-night place to study, even as late as 2 am! These redeeming qualities are the only reason this Starbucks gets two stars instead of one.

The staff here are INCREDIBLY rude and hassle you in order to get your order and get the line moving as quickly as possible. This would normally be fine but the attitudes of almost every worker here are, simply put, awful. Over the times I've studied here, I've witnessed an employee here shout at a student and another employee roll their eyes at another customer who didn't know the difference between two kinds of coffee.

I guess this kind of behavior is acceptable when your customer base is a revolving door of students who come to you for caffeine out of necessity rather than free will.

Also, they charge $1 for a cup of water. Seriously? This is Starbucks, where their profit margins are wider than Hey Arnold's head; charging for a water is the epitome of cheap in my eyes - especially in this industry!

Save your time and go to another cafe if you can -- there are plenty of other options in the area. And if you insist on Starbucks go to the one at 34th and Walnut: the service is much, much better.",0

457821,1,"I am writing to express my concerns about the treatment that my wife and I received by three team members located at the St Louis (Natural Bridge Rd) Hertz. 

There was confusion about the rate upon returning the car - due to the fact that we were unable to provide AAA discount information. That's my fault and I understand that.

However, we were astonished at the lack of professionalism displayed by one particular team member named Nicole, and her two co workers that also joined in continuous bantering at our expense.

Nicole went out of her way to make us feel uncomfortable by intentionally engaging in verbal conflict, and felt it necessary to publicly humiliate my family by announcing to her co workers that we were wrong. It was as if she was proud and felt the need to brag that she was right. The other two team members joined in laughter and celebrated their ""victory"".

We were so embarrassed that we paid the full amount and left as quickly as we could while the three girls continued to talk down on us so that we could hear them. Their words chased us all the way to the exit.

I am very disappointed that this type of behavior is accepted within your company. I will never return to another Hertz, and I will make sure to post this message on every social media platform available. 

Please provide adequate guest service training to all guest facing team members so that no other family has to experience the level of humiliation that my wife and I did today.

4521047,1,"I stumbled upon this place bc I was craving skewers and TT skewers was closed on mondays, the disappointment was beyond imagination.

Service: terrible, I only brought enough cash to pay for what I planned to order and bc my bill and a small piece missing the lady started screaming at me incoherently. Not wanting accept my bill

Place: kind of hard to find, not too much room to sit

Food: wow I did not know it was possible to screw up making all types of meats. I ordered beef, chicken, squid, tofu puff, and bacon with enoki mushrooms. Each one was more disappointing than the other. All the spices were on the outside and not inside and almost coughed out cumin powder if I inhaled wrongly. The worst offender is the beef. Good lord, I didn't think I ordered beef jerky. It was hard to bit into and had zero flavor. The only flavor is cumin covering the taste of burnt crap. It tasted how my cat turds smells. I was disgusted and couldn't finish it. Chicken was the most tolerable one and tasted something resembling chicken and not cat turd or over burnt/unrecognizable meat. Squid had all the spices concentrated in a pocket and tasted like...well squid. Tofu puff just tasted one frozen puffs thawed out with cumin. Last but not least, I did not think it was possible to screw up  bacon........if you want to taste how someone can make bacon taste disgusting, then you must try this place. 

Price: definitely a lot cheaper, but you get what you pay for. Shitty service and shitty food. 


Overall, this place is disgusting. Not worth stopping by and if you're craving skewers on a day TT Skewers is closed, don't stop by here. TT is def the best bc those ppl know how to make them the way how these skewers are made in China. I should know, I grew up eating these",0
2201749,1,"This is a long overdue review.  I have frequently ate at Chili's and every time it is an utter disappointment.  From the Crispy Chicken, coming out soggy with oil dripping down and not even edible.  The meal was replaced with another attempt, better but not great.  Service is a hit and miss, seems like a lot of college students are staffed and high turnover.  I had a voucher for a free dessert, after waiting over 15 minutes for it, the rest of my party got fed up and left and once I received the dessert, I walked over to a random table and said the dessert is on the house, paid the bill and left.

Corporate needs to seriously take a look at all the bad reviews and make some changes instead of changing their brand and the new awnings and decor at this particular location.  Save that money and invest in training the wait staff and teach the back of the house how to prepare quality meals.

He was extremely and was extremely annoyed to be speaking with me.. again I was told there was nothing that could be done for me, and frankly I don't think they cared. 
Once the food arrived, there was no marinara for the mozzarella sticks, no blue cheese for the chix wings (which I think they charged extra for), no hot sauce for the chix wings, and the pizza was stone cold. We spent nearly $40 and they charged us a $2.50 delivery fee.

5339354,2,"Now it's taken me quite some time to actually write this review because I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to say..but here goes.........

Don't get me wrong, I do like Starbucks but I finally came to the realization that it's overpriced and overrated.  I was a Gold status for quite a few years as my favorite drink was the hot or iced chai tea and more recently, hot green tea.  I began boycotting them when they had the holiday red cup release in 2018 for the fact that I received by red cup but with no lid since the store was out --- the barista @ that time advised me to just visit another location or call and ask Starbucks and they should be able to give me one because they sometimes just ship to few to the individual stores.  I went around and asked other locations who were sold out of the cups and didn't have any extra lids so I proceeded to call Starbucks as well as post an inquiry online.  I was not given any help or support for this...just basically ""oh well"" and they couldn't do anything about it.  Now my concern is how can Starbucks send a store a certain number of red cups but not enough lids for the cups.  Is the expectation for guests to have their HOT drinks in lid-less cups!? I could spill my drink on myself and it's not cool to have my Starbucks HOT drink in a lid-less cup because most of the time you're on the go when enjoying your overpriced drink.  Based on the level of service I've had at other establishments when there are shortfalls or issues w/things when being a committed customer, I was surprised by the level of service and just lack of caring I received when I spoke to someone at corporate about the issue.  

When I look at Starbucks now,  not being intrigued or care to be a Gold star status anymore, I don't know why consumers are so crazy about this place!  It can't be that the drinks are THAT amazing that people are willing to pay so much for their iced coffee.  When I used to get the Chai tea --- it was never made fresh --- the chai comes out of a cardboard container, heated or iced.  Yes, I used to be one of these people but not anymore .... and now I would rather save that $5 that I used to spend on a drink and get a smoothie from a place that tastes much better and is not overly sweetened and unhealthy. I'm always amazed at how any Starbucks establishment always has a crowd --- you almost never see one that's empty or not busy in some capacity.  And as I look at other reviews on Yelp, I can see that mine is clearly one of the very few that isn't 4-5 stars.",0

I tried using an intercom in the parking lot to ask where the office was. The lady on the other end seemed to not answer/hang up.

I guess the consult was waiting for the therapist to come in to the room where I waited 10 minutes after being brought to the room 5 minutes late. Then the massage was over 65 minutes later. I felt like I was taken advantage of. Very poor business. I will never go back.,0
6341255,1,"Used to love the place. It was a go-to-restaurant when you wanted quality and a meal you knew you were going to enjoy. Order 8 boned wings. They were small, over cooked and cost $1.12 each. Too expensive for the quality. Also ordered 24 boneless wings which were average. Requested Bleu Cheese cups to accompany the meal. Way back when, the cups used to be filled with the sauce and chucks of Bleu cheese. Not any more. Just watered down sauce and the cups aren't even half filled. Used to love the celery which was wrapped in paper. Now they just throw a few sticks of celery in a plastic sandwich bag. Not the way it used to be, that is for sure...",0
1533163,2,"When they are properly staffed, this location churns out hot and tasty burgers, fries, and breakfast items. 

The last time we went, they were down some cooks and servers, so people were walking out because they were being ignored, while others were returning dishes that must not have been cooked well. 

My family just dealt with the bad service because it's basically just teens working there, and we were having a nice family day anyway. That said, we waited 30 minutes for our food, our burgers were cold, and we never got water -- even when we asked a random waitress. We observed workers just chatting with their friends or boyfriends (I never thought I would see that, but the same waitress we asked about getting us water said ""sure"" to us and then walked over to a guy and just kept chatting with him). 

We actually laughed about our experience because it was so bad. The table next to us was there before us and were served 10 minutes after us. But they had water at least. Ha.",0
4615097,1,"Just not impressed. Ordered the 4 meat platter with 2 sides and hubby and I shared. Double order of ribs, chicken and brisket. Nothing tasted smoked or even really seasoned. The small chicken thigh and drumstick portion was dry and tasteless. The double portion of ribs equaled six ribs and was slathered at the end with a heavy coating of BBQ sauce with the meat being flavorless underneath. The Brisket (real reason we came) was ok. Generally tender but it was cold and had no flavor. No smoke or taste at all. The jalapeno cole slaw was lifeless too. No salt, acid, heat or anything and the other side of baked beans was just standard canned beans. 
Son had a burger and fries. Burger was a small preformed patty (like what you get in the grocery store freezer section) and the fries were cold and not all the way cooked. 
Only bright spot was the pork rinds appetizer. That was tasty and served with a nice dipping sauce. 
Will definitely not be back and hubby's comment was ""what a waste of 60 bucks"" Unless they make some serious changes doubt this place will be around by the end of the year.",0
3190511,1,"Boy am I stupid. Needed another CV axle replacement and tried to use them again because the location was most convenient. Over a week ago, I set an appointment for today at 8:30. Left my car with them instead of waiting because I had work responsibilities. Joe in the service department asked me if I was Ok if it took 2 days in case they didn't have the CV axle in stock. Said he would call me with cost and timing of repair. 5 hours later after hearing nothing, I left a voicemail for Joe. He called me back an hour later and amazingly he told me they hadn't even looked at it yet. Said they should have it in by 5pm and since they did have the parts he expected it needed on hand that he hoped they could have it fixed today. I asked him if I shouldn't be be frustrated that they had my car for 6 hours after my scheduled appointment time and had not yet looked at it.  He got defensive and hung up on me. Then I never heard back from him. They had my car all day and likely hadn't even looked at it yet.
One of their new car salespersons has been hounding me but there is no way in hell that I would ever do business with Tom Wood again.

Service here is terrible. 90 minutes after my scheduled appointment time they are just starting to work on my car. When I scheduled the appointment I was told to expect to wait a couple of hours for the car to be ready. Advisor tried to tell me they are like a doctor's office. 
I guess it's my own fault for coming back here. 
After my last service visit here they left a shop rag in the engine area. 2 days later it caught fire. Fortunately I had a fire extinguisher in the car so I prevented major damages.

I went to a new person today, as my regular gal is leaving. I just paid $55.00 for this (see photo) pedicure. I didn't have my glasses on so if I saw what a horrible job it really was, I would of said something. This is a NO BUENO. Especially since there is so much more competition around here.

I am a regular here and I really like using the Check in coupons. But the salon is in a cell dead zone. I wish the new owner would allow customers to access the WIFI there. 
Another comment that I am noticing lately is that the seats in the pedicure area and the trays are very greasy / dirty.

As you can see by my check in's, I have been here a lot. I think it's time to find a new place.",0
3342509,2,"This is around my third time visiting. We had a 6:45 reservation and didn't get seated until around 7:20. Each time I've visited, the restaurant is out of appetizers without mentioning to us prior to ordering.  We went for my brother's birthday and he was very excited to try the pierogies. Once we all decided on apps to share, we were extremely disappointed our waitress failed to mention there were no pierogies because their machine was completely broken (not sure why they would only have one machine). For entrees, my mom tried to order the herb crusted prime rib. She was told they only offer it Friday-Sunday (there was no mention on the menu of this). I overheard the table next to us mentioning they were out of the pasta dish they tried to order and one of the date appetizers. Very disappointing, would have appreciated a short mention of it when we were seated. My final poor experience was when our food came out, my cacio e Pepe was cold...not even slightly warm.  I don't normally complain but I asked the waitress to have it reheated, which they kindly remade, however then everyone was finishing up when I received my entree. We also asked for water several times and the waitress would say one moment and never come back (the fridge with the water jugs of cold water was right behind us). 
Hopefully these are all issues related to staffing that I sympathize with, however, having a less than enjoyably experience plus the 5% covid recovery fee does not make me want to return.",0

1674384,1,My husband and I have been going here since the early 80's. The food was always excellent but the past few years they have raised the prices and the quality of the food decreased substantially. My son and I ate there this evening. We both ordered roast beef sandwiches. The price for each was 10.50. The size of the sandwich was the size of a roast beef from Arby's.  Actually Arby's is probably bigger. Will never waste my money there again. They need to worry about the food and not the ken doll look a like waiters. Horrible.,0

The first two times I went in the early evening, I ordered my burger rare and it was cooked perfectly. Very juicy and flavorful. I would have given them a 4.5 based on those experiences alone. The service was good and the accompaniments were good. The last four times I have been, the burger has been overcooked and dry. The last time I ordered it EXTRA rare, to try and avoid the overcooking, but it came out medium to medium well. My friends ordered their burger medium rare and theirs was overcooked as well. I probably will not go back. As someone who likes rare beef, I am used to restaurants overcooking, but 4 out of 6 visits is not an especially great ratio.",0

668223,1,"This review comes from a very unique place, as I am not just a female who enjoys strip clubs, I also worked at Sabel's when it first opened. Headed here in March of 2013 and I was surprised at the changes. This club is one of the few in Philly that charges more for females to enter - it was $5 or $10 for my boyfriend and $20 for me on a Saturday night. Luckily we entered during a lull and snagged two bar stools near the dark stage. Sitting was a moot point, as I had to stand and look over the heads of multiple guys standing at the stage, blocking the view. The dancers were unimpressive and I couldn't help but feel slighted when none of them even bothered to work the crowd for tips, choosing to stand with ""regulars,"" look lazily around the room and grab an occasional drink from the bar. Looking at the drink menu, I asked the bouncer where bottle service patrons sat and he looked around and told us ""they get in where they fit in.""

1814449,1,"2 years ago we took our english bulldog puppy to Society Hill Veterinary Hospital for a routine checkup and to administer vaccinations. They did a full checkup (listened to his heart and lungs) and found that he was a completely healthy dog, with the exception of a possible issue with his elbow. They administered his vaccinations, which included a flu vaccination and a distemperment, and were in the process of preparing him for an X-Ray when he suddenly developed breathing issues. They made us aware of this issue and felt that he was struggling because he was scared of the X-Ray. It never crossed their minds that he was having a reaction to the vaccinations. The only care they provided him was oxygen which did absolutely nothing to combat the effects of his reaction to the vaccination and unfortunately he passed away. When they delivered this news to us the owner of the hospital, Dr. Claudia Casavecchia made a comment to us about how english bulldogs are known to have health issues (as if that was helpful after learning that our puppy had died).

They are by far the most inept veterinary practice that I have ever experienced, they administered a flu vaccination, which had known issues of causing swelling of the face and head of dogs and then when the dog developed a breathing issue did not consider that the vaccination was at fault. Dogs are known to survive the flu, so why they are administering an unnecessary vacciation is beyond my comprehension.

The owner of the practice (Dr (and I use the word Dr loosely) Claudia Casavecchia) lacks even the most basic bedside manner, instead of apologizing and offering condolences she blames the dog passing on the breed having known health issues.  As Donald Trump would say, she's a real ""Nasty Woman"".

They have not been in contact with us since this incident, they have not been able to provide us with any closure as the necropsy was inconclusive and they have made no attempt to reimburse us the cost of the puppy.

2921934,2,"It's a decent hotel, with some good ol' New Orleans charm, but that's about it. 

What really bugged me was the fact that the very day we got there, the toilet was having problems. It wasn't flushing properly and the water wouldn't go down, rendering it unusable. Apparently the water would go down over the course of a few hours, but that's unacceptable. We put in a call to the front desk, who informed us that maintenance was gone for the day. That's it. They offered no apologies, or at the very least, attempt to sympathize with the situation. No call to an emergency plumber was made. Nothing. We again told someone the next morning, after our toilet had overflowed, and she too, didn't seem to understand the urgency of the situation. Thankfully, we were gone all day at a convention, and by the time we returned, the toilet had been fixed.

Two of our friends staying in another room had issues with their shower temperature (too cold, very little water pressure). We heard other guests complaining about their shower also. The rooms are small and basic. We had two full beds, and the way they were positioned made it nearly impossible to get from the door to the bathroom.

Clearly, the hotel could use some serious updating. I will admit that it's conveniently located close to the water, the convention center, and walkable from Bourbon St.",0

2866473,2,"Unfortunately, this was a disappointing experience... We had been waiting months in anticipation for this restaurant to open. We love KBBQ and were excited to see a Korean restaurant open in our town. In short, if you're an avid KBBQ patron, go to K-Town or even the sizzlingogi in Santa Maria is quite good.

When we arrived the host told us nicely to go to uptown for a drink and they would give us a 20% discount, since the wait was around 30 mins. Seemed like an ok offer since we're used to waiting for good food (ie arigatos, etc). It was too loud at the uptown to think straight, so we ended up waiting in our car. They didn't give us a buzzer or take down our phone number so when we went back 40 minutes later to check, the host was about to give our table to someone else. We had to show them that our name was next in line.

No Hite, OB, or Cass? At a Korean restaurant? Only Chang, Tsingtao, Kirin, and Corona. Also, didn't have Soju by the bottle. Only cocktails with Soju... Anyone that's been to Korea knows they take drinking seriously ;) Definitely a red flag.

The food was tasty, but the portions were really small. Also what probably added to the taste was the fact that we had to wait for 40 mins.
An integral part of KBBQ is lots of food - not the case here unless you're willing to pay a king's ransom.

Service was subpar. The wait staff was nice enough, but lacked in a basic understanding of the menu and general organizational skills of how to run an efficient restaurant.

4435066,2,We heard this place was comparable to other quick but tasty burger places so we gave it a whirl. I wouldn't have an interest in coming back but my husband would. I thought the patty's were fairly thin and the burger wasn't filling. The fries were average. The prices were fairly inexpensive for what you get so that was a plus but overall it was underwhelming.,0
5162724,1,"Horrible is not a word I can use to describe this place, although I only got food for take out this is rudest place I've had the displeasure of ordering food from. First of all I go in and tell the man at the receptionist stand I wanted to chicken lomein and he says ""sorry we don't have chicken wings go to the next one"" and did a waving motion as to leave the restaurant and did this a second time again before I had to fully articulate I said ""LO MEIN"". Not only were they rude in catering to my order but took atleast 25 mins to bring my order when he initially said 10 mins and the food in general tasted like horse-shit, nothing tasted liked actually food it was more like a mixture of petroleum, cleaning chemicals and raw meat. So all in all it was a very crappy experience and I won't be returning anytime soon",0

I was convinced to color my hair more blonde than I wanted and the haircut was not a high quality cut.  I left there feeling like I didn't get what I asked for, and therefore, I am not happy with my new hair color or cut.  Even thought the staff was very friendly, they tried to sell me on everything, but what I wanted.  I usually go to a high-end salon for my hair and I am accustomed to that type of pricing.

4945197,2,"I don't get the reviews of Perch Pub????????

Mel and I were happy to finally visit. The reviews are so good on Yelp. I have to assume most were written by friends or by the staff themselves. This is a two star place.

Now I wasn't looking to have my world changed. I wasn't looking special treatment, or fine dining. I just wanted to have some pub food, a few snorts, and a beer or two with my girl.

They had the opportunity to do something really different with the space but played it so safe. Take Ten stone, Pub & Kitchen, Sidecar, Good Dog, Devil's Den...shake 'em all up and spray the decors in a second floor space and you have Perch Pub. In short, you've already been here before even if you've never stepped through the door.

The food menu is the same. I mean exactly the same as the places mentioned above.....and more expensive then I'm used to seeing. I had nachos that were just ok. They use better chips than most places, but try to disguise the small amount of meat, and veg by slathering a ton of cheese whiz over everything. Mel had fish tacos that were pretty good but really small for $5.00 per taco. we tried a couple of sides and were underwhelmed all over.

The beer list is good, but again....there are a dozen other places I could get the same list. Give me something...focus on a couple of specific breweries, give me a special price to try something different, give me a tasting option....for god sakes take a risk somewhere.

The booze. This sealed the deal for me. The short pours we got were ridiculous. It's insulting when the bartenders  buddy is getting a bucket full of booze and your giving me a thimble at full price. Whiskey village looks generous in comparison! {That is not an endorsement of WV..they are far too short with their pour as well}.

Before you go back to Perch Pub go back to or try:

Varga Bar, Devil's Den, Royal Tavern, Race Street Tavern, Good Dog, Ten Stone, Sidecar, Pub & Kitchen, Misconduct. They are all doing the same as Perch. They all just do it better and mostly likely cheaper.",0

After waiting 40 minutes for my order I asked for status on my salad and fries since my burgers had been bagged 10 minutes earlier.

5049300,1,"PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE! 
 I had the WORSE experience in my life just talking on the phone with the owner of the business. I recently brought a groupon for this place and needed to cancel my reservation due to a family issue; when I called to cancel or reschedule my appointment, I was called horrible names such as: bitch, dumb, evil, and stupid. The lady spoke these names to me on the phone and said that she could have filled that spot with someone else and then preceded to call me out of my name to someone in her shop. She said that she is a business women and that she needs to make money; therefore she called me HORRIBLE names. I do not conduct myself in that matter and if she was a true business owner she wouldn't either.   I am hurt and upset about this phone call, this has ruined my day.  I advise people to go to Bombshell Waxing, where they treat their customers with respect and kindness. I did absolutely nothing but say I need to cancel and was treated like a prisoner in jail.

6048270,1,"This place is the penultimate example of how not to run a business. 

I initially went to State Farm for home insurance and bundled it with auto. At this stage, service was good I was given a specific person to work with and she was responsive and  helpful.

About two weeks into our plan, I'm sent a vague letter stating that our auto policy will be cancelled at the end of the month because they realized that I had two tickets in my driving history. 

I'm already struck by the fact that NO ONE at this office bothered to contact me about this. It's not a small thing; if I don't have car insurance with them, I no longer get a discount on the home insurance.

So I give them a call. I'm told I am being cancelled due to them noticing I have 2 tickets over the past 3 years, one of which will no longer matter to them in 3 days. 

I still can't figure that out -- apply to any other car insurance agency right now. Every single of them knows about your ticket history immediately and reacts accordingly. Online or off.

After more explanation about how State Farm handles its holdings than a customer should ever have to know, I'm told not to worry. Apparently with one of the tickets falling off in a few days they may be able to keep me in the same plan, but they don't know. I'm told I'll still have insurance no matter what and my premiums shouldn't change much.

I want to stress the ""don't know"" aspect. This is another theme at this place.

No call that day. No call tomorrow. I call in and know that I've gotten the same guy I spoke to before. I explain my situation again and he says ""Ah, yeah, we talked the other day"". I'm already annoyed, but I am remiss if I think I'll get any apology given that he clearly had done nothing. He's going to do more looking into this and get back to me.

I don't hear back again. I call back the next day and speak to another employee. She tells me that she will look into this. I don't hear back. Notice a pattern? This isn't 1 person either. By the time this is over, I have 3 separate people tell me on more than 4 occasions that they'll call me and then don't. 

When they do call, I've noticed that a majority are made between 4:30 and 5:00. Wonder why that is? Hint: they leave at 5:00. 

I call again and this time am told that someone else had already ""submitted"" something about it, yet they could give no details. I ask to be transferred and am on hold for quite a long time. I call and am put on hold 2 more times before I finally just leave a message.

At this point I've been trying to take care of this for almost 2 weeks with zero cooperation from the company. Meanwhile I'm scared my insurance will lapse, since that's something every insurer asks about. I have my wife call because I just can't deal with it anymore. After much of her own aggravation and phone tag with these people, they call and tell her we'll have a new premium.

Again the ""don't know"" pops up. They don't know what that premium will be. They can't even give us a concrete date that they'll charge us for it. They don't know the amount or the time, yet they want to automatically debit us for it. Seriously?

They have to wait for their underwriters to figure it out. They say they'll put a rush on it. Why haven't they already? At this point it's only a few days until our insurance ends.

We're called back with the amount. Previously it was $107 a month. This was already $4 a month more than Geico, worsened by State Farm's deductible being 2x as much. They say our new monthly premium will $145 a month. An increase of almost $40 for a ticket they should have seen to begin with.

And even at this point, they STILL couldn't tell us which day they'd take the payment! We still can't figure out how they felt this was OK.  It finally came out a few days later.

A lot of this was dealt with while on vacation, annoyingly. Once we got home, we called and cancelled all policies. We received the check for the unused amount fairly quickly. I signed up with Allstate instead. I'm paying over $500 a year less for better auto insurance with half the deductible. Try figuring that out.

I wasn't happy, but going to Yelp or something didn't seem needed. We were free of it and it was over. I'm not one to hold grudges.

Flash to today: I get home and my wife is pissed. Why? Because State Farm took $145 out of our bank account! She calls and is told that they cancelled the plan, but forgot to cancel the automatic payment.

How is this possible? We don't even have a policy! Why should anything be charged whatsoever?

I'm completely astonished by this place. Instead of having a policy holder who never has had a claim, never is late on payments and wants things to be as easy going as possible they now have two people who will go out of their way to tell everyone else to avoid this place like the plague.

Hope that was worth it.",0

2893665,1,"Wow, what a disaster this night was... visiting my brother, we chose this Tex Mex place thinking there would be some Southwest flair.  Everything seemed nice at first - it's a neat place and we ate upstairs.  After our drink order, the waitress came back with the news they're out of our chosen draft beer (a Mexican beer - should have lots of that, guys!).  Just before we order, we're told they're out of the veggie fajitas (my wife's choice).  She chooses the portobello fajita instead.  A few minutes later, the hostess comes to say that they're out of that, too. But the chef will make a special veggie fajita for her, using some other things they do have.  (We were told they were out of the veggie fajitas???)   The chips were so good (a high point of the meal) that we ate the basket quite quickly (there were 5 of us), so we put it on the side of the table to signal for a refill.  It was ignored for at least 10 minutes.  My wife wanted more coffee, but the waitress did not come over at all after taking our order - we think she was intimidated by the fact that we had several things go wrong already.  My wife finally got up and went to the nearby bar service station and asked someone there for a refill.   When our food came out (not too long of a wait), they also got us more chips (finally!).  The best meal of the 5 was a steak, medium rare with potatoes.  Two of their 'combo platters' were very meager in size but both people were rather OK with them. My wife's 'special veggie fajita' was so disappointing she only ate half of one wrap.  Some of the veggies were almost raw, while others were overdone and mushy, but it was the lack of flavor that struck her the most.  They must've just thrown some chopped veggies in butter and cooked them til warm, then added some already-cooked peppers/onions and put it on the sizzle-plate to come out.  No flavor at all.  She brought most of it home to 'doctor up' into something tasty the next night.
  My meal was three tacos- standard fare for any imitation mexican place.  I asked for beef, chicken and fish, and requested real taco shells - the soft corn tortillas.  They came out on one tortilla each (any self-respecting taqueria serves tacos on two tortillas), and they were stuffed full, the waitress said because the standard flour tortillas or crunchy shells are bigger.  As soon as I picked up the first taco, it started to fall apart - needs 2 tortillas!  But the biggest surprise was when I took a bite and quickly put it back down before it made a mess.  Chewing it up, I wasn't sure exactly what I was eating... was that the chicken or the beef?  It literally did not taste like anything.  I could not taste the meat, the cheese, the tomatoes or the lettuce.  It was like eating cardboard.  So I took a bite of the next one (lighter meat, so it must've been chicken), and got the exact same sensation.  I might have been chewing on my napkin, for all I could tell.  Even the fish taco had very little flavor, except for two bites in the middle where there was a blob of some kind of spicy sauce.  The other 3 bites tasted like nothing.  A spoon of salsa on each of the others helped a little.  When the waitress came back to ask if things are OK, I just smiled.  She inquired again, and I told her about the missing tortillas - to which she said, 'well we are not a Mexican restaurant.'  WOW! no kidding..... Anyway, to avert a mess, she brought tortillas and that did help keep the tacos from disintegrating.  But it couldn't help their quality.  That was beyond the lowest taqueria I have ever visited.  For a tex-mex place to mess up tacos this bad is just ridiculous.  The poorly conceived & executed 'special veggie fajita' was maybe excusable since they were under pressure, but tacos????? come on.... 
Now, after reading this, you might think my wife and I are just 'problem guests' but if you look at my other posts, you will see that we recognize good places and good service just as much as we 'call out' the bad places.  We try to be fair.  This place was just bad.... at least for us.",0

1782931,1,"Dishonest and deceptive, even by by car dealership standards.
We were looking to purchase a very specific Altima model (black 2.5 SV with moon roof and spoiler) and called Auffenberg to ask if they had one in stock before we came out, as we were roughly an hour away.  They assured us they did, so we drove down.
When we got there, we were told ""that woman over there just bought it, but what about a white 2.5 SL?""  My wife (who was already not doing great as her grandfather was very ill) actually asked the woman they pointed out, and the woman replied that she had not actually bought an Altima at all.  Clearly this was just a bait-and-switch.
Against my better judgement, my wife searched their lot for a reasonable alternative and found car she liked.  This is when things went bad to worse.
For the next two hours we were given a full-court press on buying the $1,500 Security+ Package.  The finance manager promised us a great deal, that if we didn't use the warranty package, we would be refunded the full price of it at end of term (75,000 miles)
I write this review at the 75,000 mile point, and here is the reason for the 1-star.  When we called to have them honor this agreement, the new finance manager said ""sure, just show me on paper where we said specifically that.""  He said that they may TELL me about a refund, but if I can't prove it with a signed document they will not honor it.  Additionally, they didn't start saving customer documents on their end until the week after we purchased.

Bottom line, we were stupid.  We were worn out from 120 minutes of getting hounded to buy an unnecessary warranty and believed a man who shook our hand and assured us his word was good.

She kept messing up our orders and made my brother right the order for her, she was completely clueless! We are supposed to be out having a relaxing time instead we felt stressed. We all came back from work and decided to have a calm and relaxing dinner but that wasn't the case. I asked her to bring everyone yum yum sauce and she looked at me extremely weird. She came back with it and she brought us spicy mayo, sirachi, and yum yum for each of us, she blamed me for her mistake when everyone at our party was listening to what I asked. She got annoyed and was like ok. She left and she came back and said it's last call now, we hadn't gotten our food yet, she spent 20 min figuring out what to write on her order card and wasted our time. We told we hadn't even received anything yet and she was like ok and walked away. They came with our hibachi before our appetizer and sushi! And she messed up our order we ordered 5 hibachi meals and got 8 and she than proceeded to say that we have to pay for what's left in an extremely loud noise, we know we have to pay for that. Than came out our apps it came out less that 5 minutes after our hibachi everything was extremely rushed. I felt like I was working because I'm passing around all our food to everyone and wasn't able to enjoy my plate. She came out with the sushi and kept telling us that the kitchen has closed and we can only get ice cream we had enough by than and my mom was telling her how she felt extremely rushed and she was like yea I know and than my brother said how she was making us feel rushed and how we won't be coming back again and she was like oh you don't have to come back and walked away and he was like oh you don't care right and she laughed so so loud and went to the sushi Chiefs and talking to them about us while we are 10 feet away from her. My brothers both went up to the manager and told them what had happened and the manager just said one word and that it, a very lame unapologetic sorry. He didn't give us a discount or anything (they told him that they didn't want one) but it still should have happened and he didn't even come to our table to apologize to the party. We rented the private room for parties, go there once or even twice a month to enjoy family dinners and this is how we are treated. We felt sick to our stomachs. All they want is your money and they don't care about how you feel. Koizi we are never stepping foot inside your restaurant again and all the people we know won't",0
4761391,1,"Chucks plumbing has predatory pricing. We had them out to install a kitchen sink faucet. The trip fee is $49.00.  This was understood. when they got to the house they said it would cost over $300 to install the faucet (we already had the hardware).  I sent them home paying the $49 fee. We installed it ourselves over lunch in less than 45 minutes.   Their effective hourly charge would have been over $400 an hour. 

They are counting on you not wanting to waist the $49 trip fee. Do not use them!!!!

My fiancé had an appointment scheduled 5 months in advance for Ruby Gore. Clearly Ruby's work is great thus the 2 stars. If it weren't for her good work I'd give the shop 0 stars.

For context I am heavily tattooed and have dealt with numerous tattoo shops. None with this type of experience, despite several artist having 6+ month wait list.

Jake is some kind of scheduling assistant. He is the main person that was dealt with during our experience. After the first date booked was now unavailable we gladly rescheduled. Then again. 

And again.

And again.

5 times her appointment was moved because the assistant, Jake, was unaware of Ruby's schedule. Talk about not caring about your customer...

Requesting off for dates from work 5 times is straight stupid. Asking people to baby sit 5 different times is crazy stupid. Finding a dog sitter 5 times is stupid dumb. Planning hotels for our of state drive 5 times, stupid crazy dumb.

4980896,1,"As somebody who spends a ton of money on booze and food in and around the Music Row area - I can positively say I have never been more dissatisfied with service or been treated so rudely by anyone than I just was by the manager at The Row Nashville. I will never spend another dollar there (because they're going to take more than you ask them to, anyway).

First things first the place is way overpriced and the food is decent, but not great. There are several better priced restaurants, with better food, within walking distance of this place. 

Outside of that, I had a horrible experience with them this week. We went for a group happy hour - they told us what the specials were and it changed 47 times. Then halfway through our event (first drink was paid for by the organization on a ticket, and then we all opened tabs for our other drinks) they pull my friend aside because she said the event up and the manager said ""Your group isn't f'ing (yeah, he said the f word) tipping!"" and throws $6 at her. Well, nobody tipped yet, because we all still had tabs open. So we had already decided that we weren't going back there and I was putting all my receipts in today and saw where on one receipt they charged me $5.46 for my purple haze and then my other receipt that my friend closed out for me with 2 beers on it was only $8.74 - which ok it's only a dollar - but how many other people did they screw out of a dollar? We had like 100 people there.

SO I call to just discuss with the manager - my opening line is - I know this is just a dollar and ordinarily I wouldn't call about it, but I wanted to make you aware that not only did your manager yell at my friend regarding tips (when, after it was all said and done, they were tipped graciously) - but I want you to be aware that people were being charged all willy nilly. He then decided to argue with me about what the drink specials were supposed to be, to which I asked him to explain why I had 2 different amounts charged if there was NEVER going to be a discounted sale on Abita. Instead of trying to explain that to me he cut me off rudely midsentence and said - ""fine, what do I need to do to make you happy?"" So I said - well, first I'd like for you to not be rude to me - and he said ma'am I work in customer service let's have a conversation like adults - and I told him I thought we were. Then I told him that I actually would like my dollar back now if he was going to treat me so rudely because it was on principle and he told me I would get it when I came back in and ordered food, he would take a dollar off my bill. I told him I didn't want to spend any more money there and he said well then I guess I cant help you. I asked for his name and he just kept asking if there was anything else he could do for me and I asked for him name again and he hung up.

o i call back and ask for his name and the name of the owner - I left my info for the owner to give me a call and Robert, ops manager, calls me back. Turns out thats the dude I was already talking to. He tells me he's sorry he missed my 2nd call and wants to go ahead and refund my dollar - so I ask him why the change of heart? And he's like why do you mean? And I said well you know we just talked and you yelled and were rude to me and told me I wasn't getting my money back why would I be getting it now ? And he claimed he wasn't being rude, but I had him on speaker and my coworkers heard the conversation - so I told him that. So he asked what he could do for me and I told him nothing that I wanted to speak to the owner and to have him call me, he said he was one of the owners, and I told him I was told he was the operations manager and I'd like to speak with Kelly. he said ""So you don't want your dollar back?"" And I said no, Robert, I don't want anything from you - I just want to speak to Kelly. Then he asked what I did and I told him where I worked and what I did and that I work on the row, and was there the other night with people that work on the row, and i have now committed myself to make sure nobody else goes to the row ever again Then he laughed and said ""well that's perfect"" and i told him I thought so, too, and to have a great rest of the day.",0

I was having a ton of pain and it didn't subside and I definitely couldn't chew on the right side of my mouth.  I called her after two weeks  and told her I was having a lot of pain and I have been told that Its normal and the pain should go away after two to three weeks. 

I made a second appointment for her to examine me since the right side that she filled was still so uncomfortable and I couldn't chew still.  I was exposed to so much X-ray radiation and also had to pay for another visit , only for her to tall me everything looked perfect and I was fine.

long story short I basically had to find another dentist to redo my filling since she did a clumsy job and did not wanted to take responsibility for it.

Well, our room had no patio or balcony. We called and asked if we were given the correct room-yes we were, not all premium rooms have a patio. Wow, wish we would have known that before coughing up the over $800. At 7:30 when our daughter went to bed, our evening was over, instead of enjoying dinner on our patio as planned 

Room service was slow. We asked for our dishes to be cleaned up and two and a half hours later when we returned to our room, they were still there. Not the type of service I expect at these prices.

4052171,1,"Brought 2 garbage bags full of paper to shred to this store.  Paid for one of the bags and while Ryan is handing me the receipt he tells me their shred policy is for me to leave my bag of sensitive information there at the store for all the employees to have access to until the next day when their shred vendor gets there.  Then he's going to give my bag of sensitive information to the vendor to put in the shred bin.  It's 12:46pm.  That means every employee from now until tomorrow, along with the vendor can just rummage through my sensitive information.  So, I tell Ryan I would like to place the items in the shred bin myself.  Another employee, Marvin, tells Ryan no one is allowed to be in the store when I do it, and they told me to wait.  So I patiently wait for everyone to leave, and go to start putting my stuff in the bin and they tell me I can only do it after the store closes.  They won't let me do it.  So, I asked to speak to a manager and got George, whom confirmed I'm not allowed to do it myself and not during store hours, that my sensitive information has to sit there over night and wait for the vendor to do it the next day.  Mind you, anyone that works with HIPAA has seen the shred bins.  They have an extremely tiny slot in them that no one can see into.  I posted a pic.  George tells me this is store policy.  I told him what it says online and he just said this is our store policy, sorry.  Here's what UPS website says about their shred services:. ""When you visit, we'll weigh your documents and then you'll place them into the secured, locked shredding bin. It's that easy.""  No, at this UPS location it's not that easy.  As an employee that works in the healthcare industry and deals with HIPAA on a daily basis, this is the opposite of how you handle sensitive information.  I will be filing additional complaints as the other poor unsuspecting customers have no idea of the exposure of just leaving their sensitive information there for all to see and be passed around until it finally makes its way into the bin.  This is egregious.  Do better UPS.",0
3667356,2,"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. What a strongly resounding meh of a restaurant. It hits all the classic hallmarks of niche ethnic food repackaged for a predominantly Western audience. For context, I came here for dim sum during Sunday lunchtime and split a selection of dishes from both the Cantonese and Shanghainese dim sum selections.

Overpriced? Check. Everything is marked up about 50% over any other Chinatown dim sum joint.

Overly greasy? Check. The scallion pancakes were browned and shimmery with grease.

Kitschy Asian/modernist fusion decor? Check. Check. Check. Alright, this is more a personal pet peeve, but still. No points deducted for this.

So, positives. The food, besides the scallion pancakes, was fine. Not amazing, but definitely fine. Nothing I had was noticeably bad or good. The tea was good, I'm not going to lie. Definitely load up on the tea if you come here. 

Minor pet peeve: we got one menu between two people and we asked our waiter if we could keep it in case we wanted to order more and he was just like ""nah"". Oooookay? 

Now for the ultimate pet peeve: when you order soup dumplings, you get a little platter of sauce. The platter they gave us was too small to fit the spoon you use to carry the soup dumplings around, so the only way to get the dumpling and the sauce in the same bite was to pick it up and pour it onto your spoon. What on Earth?? 

Final verdict, if you don't care about price and you need dim sum NOW, Dim Sum House is fine. It's definitely not worth a trip unless you place a strong priority on minimalist furniture and what are probably higher sanitation standards than other Chinatown places. 2/5.",0
1094167,1,"East Nashville Location, 11/6/2014...Let me say first, I did not eat any food... I left the drive-thru line.... This message is about poor introduction, delivery and ultimately poor service. In the drive-thru line, I was handed a poor photocopy of a menu without prices.  Virtually unreadable, I inquired about burger sizes, options and pricing. After choosing, I was told my choice was ""about $3.80 something and here, hand this to the girl"". Handed a hand written note on lined yellow paper I moved forward.  I handed the note to the girl and then came to the menu board which I now could read.  Well not only was the menu confusing, the price I was told for my single burger of choice looked like it was going to cost considerably more.  I waited, and wanted to ask to make sure and possibly change my order but was unable to in a timely manner. Since the line was moving slowly already, I thought I would do myself and the people in line behind me a favor and just move on. I won't be back.  Good Luck!",0

We had to stop because the mold smell was so intense, it never left your nose until you left the restaurant and cleaned your nose, not to mention your cloths. Since 2015, every now and then, I go into the restaurant to see if the mold is gone. My last walk in to verify cleanliness was July 13, 2018 at noon and the place smelt like it was highly perfumed. Went back outside and noticed the AC was the old system. As long as the old AC system, which should include the entire duct work, remains in service, the mold can never be totally removed.

I was walking past this place last night when I witnessed one Krazy Korner employee throw a cup of clear liquid on a homeless person. This homeless person was sitting peacefully at the corner of this place. The homeless person looked like they were trying to get some rest- not doing anything to anyone! Even after having liquid thrown on them, they did nothing. Three other Krazy Korner employees witnessed this and laughed hysterically. It was completely disgusting and uncalled for.

4167206,2,"I want to start by saying that it may have just been a really off night.  was visiting Peppermill to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with a group of friends. Everyone I asked raved about this place, so our expectations were high as we were seated. The ambiance was good, the wait staff were very friendly and professional. 

We ordered our drinks, my boyfriend ordered the smoky old fashioned, which was prepared table side, we were all in high spirits. 

There were some appetizers ordered: oysters, ceaser salad, smoked salmon salad, artichoke raviolis, scallop and foie gras. As we waited on our food, we heard a raised voice near us and looked over to see an angry customer yelling at the manager on duty. We couldn't exactly make out what was being said, but at one point the guest followed the manager to the back of house, and we could hear him cussing the manager out. 

The oysters came out. They smelled so fishy that I could smell them 2 seats down. They were sent back. 

The raviolis came out. My boyfriend took a bite, and he looked confused.  I took a bite and spat what was in my mouth into a napkin. So did the other 2 that tried it. I can only describe it as a pungent sour flavor that punched me in the face and lingered long after. We sent it back. 

Everything else was just okay. Living in the Bay area, our food quality expectations might be higher than normal, so maybe I am more critical, but at over $700 for the meal, I was hoping to be wowed. I definitely was not. 

Also, my friend asked to use his comps, they overcharged him somehow (his bill was $120, they took $160), and his players card was showing negative $40 comp for the rest of trip. 

We still tipped the server 20% as I know it's not his fault, the manager did come to apologize, which was appreciated, but when all is said and done, we definitely will never dine here again.",0

I emailed the company multiple times regarding a whole month of zero output during the peak of California summer; the company failed to respond.

We also had issues with our salesperson who admitted that he could not follow through on the 220V installation because all of his assets were frozen; presumably from fraudulent conduct in his role at Vivint. I have written documentation supporting this. 

Based on our experiences, the securities class action lawsuit against them, and TCPA class action settlement, I am now convinced that their practices are intentionally deceptive and fraudulent.

2028571,1,"YOU WON'T ONLY BE SORRY, YOU WILL DIE OF THIRST..... a Bactrian camel could not survive we were so thirsty.......SAD THING IS THE STAFF COULD NOT CARE LESS...... Zero GLOVES WORN BY COOKS, kitchen help came out to get a drink and never the 1st handwashing......WOW!!

I don't know where to start. I live here in New Orleans, my brother and his daughters were in from Arizona. I was wanting to show them an iconic New Orleans Staples, such as Daisy Dukes. I remember when this place was American Pie Diner and it could not have been better. Upon Daisy Dukes taking over, service has declined, the quality of the product is not the same as they are at other locations, and the staff was inherently rude. Never mind the fact there were food particles all over the place and in this growing age of COVID-19, I felt very uncomfortable. Nevermind the fact there is no handwashing going on, people touching their faces that were behind the line and the service desk..... I did not see the first repository of hand sanitizer anywhere in the building nor did I noticed any red buckets for cleaning.

So, we walk in at 11:33 a.m., according to my Google timeline, and we then proceeded to sit there for about 5 minutes before a middle-aged woman, with a bad case of resting bitc* face, with pinkish hair, and a wrinkled face finally came over to us and dropped off menus. She then proceeded to handle other guests and sit at least two or three tables. Those tables got sat, they got served, and they got menus, they got drinks placed on their table, meanwhile, they entered the building 10 minutes after we did. At the 15 minute mark, she comes over to say ""hey I have your drinks on the bar and I'm going to get them to you shortly."" Another table comes in and they get from sat,, drinks, and menus. Meanwhile, I'm staring at a menu in a table with four other people and my brother says to me ""is this the best New Orleans can do?"" We persisted to wait while other guests continue to get served and handled before we did despite coming in after us. We never once had an interaction with this woman so it's not as if we're being unreasonable. We were just sitting here for 15 minutes and not one drink was placed on the table. After another 10 min, I finally asked her, ""hey, other tables get served, sat, menus, and drinks. Why exactly is my table being made to suffer?"" She again said ""well your drinks are on the bar and I'm trying to do the best that I can"", to which I responded, ""well if this is the best you can do, it's definitely not good enough."" ""25 minutes and not even a drink..... she then snapped around and nastily claimed it hadn't been 25 minutes Honey, you lost the point. Take care of your customers and quit having personal conversations and you might be able to get something done

Stay away!  this place is horrible since Daisy Dukes has taken over and I could not be more disappointed at a New Orleans pillar of hospitality and foodservice.

4370893,1,"I wish I had bothered to read ""yelp"" before purchasing a used car from these lying A*******.  I was promised many things, in fact, literally purchased the car over the phone from Eric Van Reusen.  First he tricked me into giving him a $1000 over the phone in order for them to hold the car until I got there, but because I wanted this particular year and model, I was suckered into doing so.  Once I got there, though the car was pretty much what I wanted, I expected an extremely pleasant experience...my bad...ever thinking that would be possible with ANY DEALERSHIP...though I have purchased many cars from CARMAX and have never been lied to like the people who represent Bill Pearce.  

I was visiting from California and was told I would have no issues registering out of state...to my dismay, everything changed after I gave them my credit card over the phone for the security deposit.  Because I was unwilling to lose my security deposit to these cheating bastards, I was forced to deal with hours and hours of taking off time to deal with the DMV process myself.  I made a long distance call from the California DMV to Eric explaining some issues I was having, he wasn't there and I was passed onto Angel...God help you if you have to deal with that woman and her incredibly poor attitude...it's clear she hates her job as well as anyone who calls and asks her a question.  As rude as she was, I was unprepared to be hung up by her.  First she's verbally abusive to me over the phone, then hangs up on me.  I then called back and was sent to Jason, the man who prints up all those lovely forms and has you sign.  When I was there purchasing my car, he told me the extended warranty was for 5 years, interesting that though I signed many forms, he didn't give me all of them and I later found out that the warranty is only good for 4 years and I'm paying bloody hell for what I purchased included a hefty $200 co-payment should something go out on it.  But that wasn't my concern at the time I spoke to him, my concern was that he had totally messed up my paperwork and though I thought Angel was rude, it would turn out that Jason surpassed her by leaps and bounds...funny, he wasn't that rude when I agreed to purchase the extended warranty. 

I then proceeded to try to speak to someone with any kind of authority...no such luck...everyone treated me like  a bum from the street.  NO ONE THERE HAS AN HONEST BONE IN THEIR BODY!!!  Later on during the week, I had texted my salesman Eric and told him that I needed to get the key code in order to re-program the key pad on the outside of the door...I HAVE IT IN WRITING FROM HIM...AND EVEN FORWARDED IT BACK TO HIM...wherein he tells me to go to any Ford Dealership and they will ""give"" me the code.  Before I forwarded him the text, he actually wanted to argue with me that he never ""promised me they would pay for the code""...I said ""No Eric, you didn't promise, you just told me they would give it to me...look up the word in the dictionary and maybe you'll see where my confusion lies.""  

When I went back to visit my family in Carson City, I did go to the Ford Dealership...they informed me that they didn't just ""give out"" a key code, they charged $55 for it.  The service man immediately called Pearce and explained the situation.  He was promised they would get back to him immediately....3 hours later and me trying on my own to get a P.O. from them, finally spoke to Barry Bell who promised me he'd return my call within 15 minutes...again, another hour passed with no word from him and then he was conveniently unavailable when I kept trying back.  I eventually paid for it myself.  However, when I tried calling the general manager, Mike Freitas when I returned back to California, he informed me he was told I only had to pay half of the cost.  I informed him that whomever gave him that inaccurate information, was wrong and or lying to him, however, I'm pretty sure Mike knew exactly what was spoken and was just trying to avoid acting like a real General Manager.  Even after I told him I had it in writing from Eric that it would be ""given to me"", he disregarded my concerns...all of them, because at that point I told him several of the lies that had been told to me...he said I should speak to Barry Bell...when I told him that Barry had no clue what the hell he was doing and that he ignored me the whole time, he still refused to be a GENERAL MANAGER and pushed my issues aside and transferred me to housekeeping.  Go figure!!!  

I am shocked that a place that looks pretty on the outside as well as the inside, would actually get away with these practices.  Furthermore, if Bill Pearce is a real person, why is he allowing this behavior to go on.  

There is a damn good reason buying a car from a dealership is stressful, because you have lying through the nose people like this.  I hope they fail as a business, because how they treat people is most disgusting.  Next stop, Better Business Bureau!",0

Never got a paper statement in the mail or was asked to make any sort of payments until that huge one 3 months in... was waiting for a paper statement like I had initially received?

I know COVID is stressful for everyone and a scary situation for those at higher risk. On their recording they asked everyone that goes to
The clinics wear masks now unless you have a child under 2 - for them it isn't required - which I am fine with. I have to bring my 1.5 year old daughter In because my husband works and I have no child care otherwise. Also not to mention, I'm trying to prevent my daughters and my (a very pregnant woman) exposure to COVID. At my 39 week appointment I checked in with my daughter and waited about 10 min to be taken back. Went into a back room and waited another 10 min after my initial temp and weight was taken, the nurse had left the door open for that ten min which I thought was odd. She finally came back in and told me that I couldn't have my daughter at the appointment. She told me it was because of COVID. Even though I had brought her to the last 4 appointments... I told her the recording said it was fine. And she asked me what recording. I told her and she said she was going to go listen to it. I stopped her and said if she can't be here, that's fine, I'm just going to leave. I'm not going to wait another 20 min for them to decide if I can be seen or not. Long story short - they saw me and everything was fine. A different nurse told me it was that specific practitioner that wanted to limit her exposure and risk to COVID. That's okay for her to do... they should have asked that when scheduling rather than making me feel like a bad person for bringing my very well behaved child to an appointment. The whole situation was dealt with in a very unprofessional way and none of the staff knew anything about if she could be there or not.

5001936,1,"I came here because it was close to the medical school and they heavily advertised here. For the first 6 months the parking garage had no remote entry (it was closed every day from 7pm to 7am), and the few times I did manage to use my car, I had to pay 180$ for the privilege to go all the way up to the 6th floor, walk down in the garage to the 3rd floor, and then cross over, and then finally take the elevator up to my floor.

 The Internet is slow and buggy (the roku they give is the oldest version that has none of the features that make a roku halfway decent), the water is hard and emits odor, the common areas are a disaster (with exception of the balcony, which is nice, but the grill is never clean or functional), the movie room does not have a cable box or a functioning sub-woofer, and now apparently they are instituting a curfew at midnight where the balcony, movie room, common area, and hot tub (which is always dirty and nonfunctional, in fact they locked the controls so you can't bring it up to temperature any more) are off limits because some squatters started to smoke crack on the 2nd floor (this is real, not exaggeration).  Additionally, some Taiwanese started sleeping (again, i'm not exaggerating) ten to a room (presumably because they can't afford the rate otherwise) - and began to take turns sleeping in the media room and common areas. 

With the apartment itself, you are basically paying 3$ a square foot for a glorified cubicle, with cheap fixtures, thin raggedy easily stained carpet, press-board cabinets of the lowest line, shower glass that goes only 1/3 the way of the tub such that your whole bathroom is a mess after showering for only seconds... the list goes on and on. The 'gym' is literally one treadmill and weights that go up to 25 lbs...  The art is also very weird and highly publicized. The doormen are nice though. 

I'm normally a fan of government, but these guys got the federal go-zone guarantee, so they don't have to finance their debt on a cash basis. They therefore have no incentive to a) lower rent to a reasonable rate, b) negotiate with individuals who want to stay on but can't accept these things with a 3$ rate, or c) actually improve their facility. Because they can't fill the rooms at these astonishingly high rates, they turn to corporate renting which means you have high turnover quickly, and no real community feel...

When I took my jeep to another place they told me the part I was apparently missing was in fact a factory recall and replaced with a different part, there was even a factory sticker under my hood confirming this. I went back to a-smog it and told them how they messed up and they told there was nothing they could do. I was stuck with $500 in smog/gross polluter bills.

1056473,1,"I wish that there were an option for no stars, because there was literally not a single positive in my visit to Eve's.  It was filthy, sloppy, the waitstaff was deplorable and the food just outright SUCKED. 

Let's start with the waitstaff, all of whom look like recent parolee's of a women's prison with an attitude to match. Have a question about the meal? Fuck you paying customer! Taking to long to decide what you want (i.e.- more than two minutes)? Be prepared for a massive eye-roll and sigh as they tell you they'll come back. The waitress brought out the wrong omelet to my mother-in-law and instead of explaining what was happening she simply runs over and sticks a spoon in her omelet, grabs the plate, and runs back to the kitchen mumbling. Literally NO explanation. When she grabs it, my MIL's english muffin falls off the plate almost onto the floor and they don't even offer to get her a new one. 10 minutes later a new omelet comes out- complete with a new spoon mark and THEN they decide to explain what has happened. Who does that?????

The food is just...ugh...there are no words to describe how someone can fuck up breakfast but Eve's Family Restaraunt managed to do just that. It looked as though they had been waiting all day for someone to order raisin toast and eggs. It was WAY overcooked, the toast was burnt with no butter available to moisten it. The eggs were hard and had a film on them as though they'd been waiting under a hot lamp for at least an hour. I asked for cheese on my eggs and it comes out with a slice of Kraft single on top- not melted mind you, but haphazardly tossed on right before hitting the table. If only I could have drowned my eggs in ketchup, but all the offered was a runny bottle of cheap hunt's that looked like it hadn't been wiped off in ages. This place is suck-central. The only reason I can assume that it has such a loyal following of local retiree's is because their tastebuds, sense of smell, and eyes no longer function properly. 

It was dirty too! They just can't get anything right here! I watched a busser wipe off a table filled with mushy potato and ketchup, then use the same rag to wipe down a bunch of menus. What kind of shithole are they running here?

Just no. So much no to Eve's.",0
5199312,1,"Eat here at lunch with co-worker and the waitress was very nice and on point. With that being said, the food was beyond horrible. I got the calamari as an appetizer and it taste like it was freezer burned and out of a bag from Walmart. The fries were in a dish that tasted soapy making the fries taste like a mild soap. I took them home to let my wife taste just to verify and she confirmed as well. My coworker got the lobster lovers and he almost vomited in my truck because the blandness of the entire meal. 80 bucks later I realized I would never go not to this red Lobster but any red Lobster I see!

4614325,1,"The absolute worst complex I have ever leased from. I have rented luxury apartments for the past 6 years. This is horrendous, the maintenance repairs are shotty, the construction that is done to ""renovate"" apartments is half assed and done with the worst appliances that can be bought. Apartment is filled with insects, ants, roaches, you name it and the leasing office ignores complaints. I've asked numerous times to get a copy of my lease and have been ignored. The ""valet"" trash service that you pay for is terrible. Half the time my trash is left outside and not picked up so raccoons tear into the trash and I'm forced to pick it up because god forbid the maintenance or leasing office have to do it. I have witnessed the maintenance team remove dog waste bins from an entire side of the complex and not replace them so you are left with dog waste everywhere making the complex smell like shit 24/7. The leasing office sends updates for renovations that are absolutely unnecessary and a waste of the tenants rent. They think a dog washing station under a huge tree with falling leaves and dirt is an appropriate place to wash your dogs when it is constantly filthy and never cleaned. They also took up 3/4 of the grassy area in the so called dog park to place ridiculous cheap ""agility"" obstacles that look like they were shipped in from a Chinese warehouse and have spikes and metal corners protruding from all the agility obstacles. Completely unsafe, dirty neighborhood that is no where near the amount of rent. Also had to put up with 2 months of construction above my apartment of constant slamming, stomping and so called renovation. Then when new tenant moves in I can literally hear every single movement they make above me. RENTERS BEWARE DO NOT RENT AT THIS PROPERTY


Update for Susan, She's exactly right, at this very moment in my apartment 4111 (I am apartment 4112) they are renovating it and the window was left open for 3 nights in a row and I witnessed a raccoon crawl out of the window while I walked my dog at 7am. Who knows how long it was in there for and the amount of palmetto bugs that invested the apartment. This complex is on the edge of gandy beach water, filled with bugs. And my neighbor just recently told me that she walked into her own apartment and a maintenance man was using her sink and had no explanation to why he was in her apartment other than ""I'm checking the appliances"". Absolutely not no service request and no reason to be in the apartment, that is against the law. This place is sketchy the repairs are half ass and renovated with horrible products that break in a month. She's also right about the leasing office, worst customer service in the world they absolutely do not care about the tenants, of course they will entertain your complaints initially but nothing is done in the long run.",0

4156590,1,"Patients be warned - do not assume that Eskanazi Hospital is there to help you - absolutely no information was given to my husband or myself when my husband came in to the emergency room about the financial liabilities one will incur if admitted into their ""Observation room"". No one gave us any information about what an observation room is and what would be done in this section of the hospital. Observe means to observe where I come from, but this is not what is done. No talk of alternatives that would be an affordable treatment were discussed with us. We were left in the dark on everything. We asked countless times if our insurance would cover the care that they wanted to provide, everyone smiled and said not to worry - $11,000 later in less than 18 hours is what we got for that. My husband was there over 14 hours before anything was mentioned to him, a very sick man, in a dark room surrounded by doctors and no family member present that the care he was receiving was not covered and would be all out of pocket - they had him sign a paper that he was unable to read due to his illness. Shameful beyond belief. We have tried over 9 months to get to the bottom of their actions and policy of admitting anyone to their observation area of their hospital. Nothing and I mean nothing but endless waits or people not returning calls, spouting of policies that had nothing to do with the questions we were asking all came to naught, sent on a full circle from one dept to another, repeating our story over and over and over, got us no where accept right back to where we started. I just warn everyone that the Patients Rights that state you will ""receive care and understandable information about your care and services before agreeing to them: and you will ""actively participate in all decisions about your care"" are nothing but a sham.

3953270,1,"I went to the Arizona beer house to, honestly, just get an orange cream soda. To take home. I grab my soda and walked up to the bar. It's a Friday night and almost 7 o'clock I get it is going to be busy. The place was packed but there wasn't too much going on in the bar area. There were 3 girls to the right of me chatting away who already had their drinks. There was a gentleman sitting a few seats to the left of me who was lost in his phone slowly sipping on a beer. And one woman standing there who was clearly waiting for the bartender who was doing the most awful job of pouring I have ever seen in my entire life. There was literally nothing but foam. She kept having to dump it out. She dumped several pints worth of beer out because she simply could not pour it. This was taking forever. I want to help her not just so that I could get out of there but to save her from her embarrassment. My irritation rose because when I walked up to the bar there was a gentleman behind the bar as well. He was puttering around doing things. Before I could get his attention another gentleman, with a beard, walked up to him said something and they both left the bar area. So now I'm still waiting for ""not able to pour"" to get her crap together to purchase my soda. She finally gets the 2 beers poured and rings the lady up. She turns and looks at me and smiles and as I raised my soda up she walks over to the guy sitting a few seats down from me who very clearly did not need any help and asked him if he wanted another beer. She then proceeded to go get it for him. I'm still standing there with my soda. Almost 25 minutes later I'm now in my car with my soda and I'm incredibly pissed. I don't even want the damn soda anymore. I had been here a few times before for geeks who drink so I knew about the single take home options. I always enjoyed it and it seemed like a cool place.

3475735,1,"Asshole Cabbie Alert!. From the other two reviews it looks like that it isn't the case with All City all of the time. But the one that the fellow members of the Deli Philadelphia staff and I encountered was so horrible that I've chosen to avoid this cab company at all costs!

After promoting a successful show at Johnny Brenda's (you all missed it due to my last minute posting - http://www.yelp.com/events/philadelphia-deli-magazine-presents-an-american-chinese-grandchildren-the-armchairs-and-savoir-adore). We were so drained that we craving nothing but Chinese Food at David's, and the eventual slumber that was to follow. So we decided to split a cab three ways and get to Chinatown quicker. Unfortunately we chose the wrong cab!

From Johnny Brenda's to Chinatown you could continue down Girard until you can cut through a part of Spring Garden that has significantly less traffic. Or you could cut through some back routes to save time, which is something that a respectable cab driver might try to do. But instead this douche decided to go down Northern Libeties when people were starting to leave and drive away from the bars, and left the meter running when the cab wasn't moving.

That should have been are indication to jump out and find a better cab immediately after. But that point we were far to drained and craving our goal to care. So onward we rode. After NoLibs, you would have thought that the driver would have gone through Spring Garden, Vine Street, or any other street before Race Street that would have given us easy access to our destination. it's pretty logical to assume right? WRONG! instead this ass clown decided to ride all the way to Market Street and even more traffic. And of course he still managed to leave the meter running when he wasn't moving anywhere.

Finally after one more unnecessary turn in Chinatown we FINALLY reached our destination.Unfortunately for him, his milking us for money and time in such a crass way led to me calling him an asshole under my breath being his tip for the evening. it's really a shame, because it's ass clowns like this one who give the Philadelphia cabs such a bad name.

4248196,1,"I wish I had paid attention to all of these negative reviews before I brought my children to this dentist office. I am writing this review as a WARNING to other parents not to bring their children here. Dr. Solow seems like a knowledgeable enough dentist/orthodontist, but he moved forward on my child's orthodontic treatment without my consent while I was in the hallway getting a very confusing price estimate from his receptionist. This is a minor problem compared to the BULLYING, PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE behavior of his staff.

Two of Dr. Solow's hygienists mistreated my thirteen-year-old son in absolutely inexcusable ways. The first hygienist didn't communicate with him at all, and after fumbling with many failed attempts to put spacers between his teeth, she called for help from another hygienist  who was even more rude, unkind, and physically abusive. These two hygienists proceeded to gang up on him, talk about him as if he was not there, and ignore him when he asked them to stop. My 15-year-old daughter had just had her teeth cleaned and was there to witness all of this. When she spoke up on behalf of her brother, asking them to listen to him while they had him pinned down in the chair, she was told she had no right to tell them what to do. I can't believe I was on the other side of the door while all of this was happening. When I returned to the treatment area, I saw a look of rage in my son's eyes that I had never seen before. My daughter calmly explained to me how the hygienists had mistreated her brother, while they both tried to cover it up saying they just wanted to ""get the torture over with."" Was this supposed to make me (or him) feel better?

When I got home, I called the office and talked directly with Dr. Solow. He apologized immediately and asked me to repeat what had happened so he could repeat it out loud so the people involved could hear what my complaint was. I'm a forgiving person and appreciate a genuine apology, but this seemed a bit contrived--or perhaps it's a common occurrence. He didn't seem shocked or appalled by what I said. 

I have taught my children to be respectful of all people. What we experienced at this dentist office was total disrespect. I'm so glad my daughter spoke up for her brother, but I feel terrible for entrusting my children to people who clearly don't understand the basic trust and respect that must exist between a healthcare provider and a patient. Just because they have murals on the walls and cartoons on the television does not make them the ""child friendly"" practice they claim to be.

In the future, I plan to bring my children to an excellent dentist I recently saw in Havertown, Dr. Petras. I imagine she'll be great with people of all ages because she understands the importance of treating her patients with kindness, gentleness, and respect. And for my son's braces, I was happy to find Faust Orthodontics. I'm glad I learned how awful Dr. Solow's practice is before I gave them $5400 for braces.

My son asked me to write this review so other kids won't have to go through what he did. I'm so sorry I didn't pay attention to the many bad reviews that preceded mine.",0

Manager knows nothing about customer service and has lost our family business for ever. They offer kids eat free on Tuesday night. My kids got their orders, and I ordered a burger with extras. My wife just wanted a burger. Waitress told us Tuesday night is Kids Eat Free. When the check came they only took off one kid's meal. I asked why.. I was told I had to talk to the manager. He took his time (about 10 min. for me to wait). He then said you have to spend $10 on a meal to get the kid's meal. My burger was $9.95.  I said I would have been happy to order a drink had I known. He said it wouldn't of mattered because the meal has to be over $10. There was no print material nor mention of this rule by the waitress who knew I asked about the kids' eat free. The manager was an absolute jerk in his response and attitude. I was friendly throughout until he shared an attitude. I refuse to do business with an establishment who has a disrespectful and uncaring manager. This is not about cost, but principal. There are too many other good restaurant options who care about the service and quality they provide, I recommend you go to other options instead of Risky Business.",0

THREE MEALS out of five were not on the bag. None of the sides. Only one drink. I call to speak to the manager about it, and he acted like I WAS THE PROBLEM. I explained that it happens every time, and he just didn't care. I literally asked him if he was really the manager because he was so nonchalant about it. He then said, ""Ma'am, what do you want me to do about it?"" Are you kidding? I obviously want the meals. Then, he acted like it was a problem that we wanted our food. Ridiculous!!! NEVER EVER AGAIN!

6711875,2,"Husband and I ordered takeout at lunch here and maybe that was our mistake as we should have tried the breakfast? In any case, we won't be ordering food here again. The only way I can describe it is bland. Like, shockingly and amazingly bland to the point I suspect the only reason people rate this place high is portion size. 

I ordered a burger and my husband ordered the French dip sandwich. Neither of us bothered to even eat half. I tried his thinking the au jus sauce would help and even that had no flavor and did not help the dry meat in his sandwich at all. So disappointing. 

The onion rings were crispy so I'll toss them an extra star for that.

6569776,1,"Second worst manicure I've ever had. I got acrylic overlay and gel manicure with French tips. My nails are bubbled, he drilled my cuticles too far back and left bits hanging off, there is crackling down one of my nails and the polish, shape and profile of my nails is completely uneven. I asked for them to be left long; he filed them so unevenly I had him give me the file so I could even them up myself and lost about half the length. They did not drill ridiculous horizontal ridges across my nails, as I had asked them not to do BUT he did drill down into my nail when he took my cuticle off. Didn't people used to use cuticle remover? My nails look fake, bulky and cartoony; the silk wraps I just took off that I did myself for the first time looked better. They also forgot to wax my eyebrows and upper lip which I was perfectly alright with by the time I left; I hate to say it but I wonder what kind of disaster that would have been. Maybe they do a better job with their regulars, but you don't GET regulars doing a manicure like this. I feel bad for the guy; it doesn't strike me as a very nice life doing nails for fussy American women (like me). I couldn't even tip the guy because ""their system doesn't allow it"" which may be the case but that's really a disservice to their employees, who are probably working for peanuts on top of not getting any tips. The receptionist was the only English speaker there, but didn't really bother to try to find out exactly what I wanted or help me decide what to get. I would think working with the same people all the time you would develop that partnership in communication but she was young and probably just didn't know any better. On the plus side my nail tech did suggest I get the tips painted white further down than what I had initially suggested which did end up looking better under the circumstances. Also, the place was clean and there wasn't much of an issue with fumes.",0
5603905,1,"HORRIBLE delivery service! Supposedly open until 3am, so we ordered at 1:25am and still nothing had arrived at our door well after the estimated time of 2:15am-2:25am. So at 2:43am we called Saucey and no one answered and had to leave a message. 
So then I called GrubHub directly and they said they would call them. The man on the phone was nice he did say something about free food and such so YAY on that front and I am glad grub hub has better customer service than that of Saucey Pizza. I will never order from Saucey again!! So, Saucey, DON'T say your hours are until 3am on Saturdays if your'e going to abandon the job 2 hours early!

My daughter always gets birthday cake and did not try it before purchasing- our mistake. After buying it, there was certainly something wrong with the flavor. The man working said he could do nothing about it and wouldn't allow her to get a different flavor in its place. The product did not taste as it should and therefore I was flabbergasted that he was so rude to us in his response. My other daughters banana flavor had an odd mint aftertaste and was thrown away as well.

I was fine with that as I figured it would not be too long. After a few minutes, the man from the front desk returned to inform me that my car ""probably wouldn't even be looked at for at least 2-3 hours and then it would take time for my tire repair as well"". He also told me that I ""should have called before I came in to find out the live wait time as the online bookings are not updated and aren't looked at"". What is the point of having the convenience of booking an appointment online if it is not going to be acknowledged?!

I wasn't very hungry between the bubble ceiling & brown lettuce when dinner came. My $24 steak required the most chews per bite I've ever had to chew for a filet minion &, as a previous server, I couldn't get over assuming that if this restaurant is willing to show their customers the leaky bubble ceiling & ignore brown salad, what could possibly be happening in the kitchen where my food was being prepped.

Whatever. The women's bathroom was closed, the men's bathroom was disgusting and missing supplies. They weren't taking credit or debit cards--had to pay cash. Whatever. As I tried grabbing a plastic fork for my salad, I see a handful of dirty forks in a filthy (probably never been washed) utensil bin (as pictured). I asked for a clean fork. The guy walks over to the plastic fork bin. I reiterated that they're dirty and i won't use those. He dug through a bag looming for a fork and said he didn't have any and proceeded to pick up all the remaining forks in that bin, with his dirty bare hands, showed me ""this is what we have"" and motioned for me to take one. I told him no, because first of all those are dirty and second, he just had his dirty hands all over them. His response, ""yes, everyone put hands in there."" I informed him that I'd refused to use them and in fact would be reporting them to the health department and he gave me permission to do so.

He gave me my money back for one salad. Pizza tasted good. My friend got sick from her salad. I didn't eat my salad so I was fine. 

The whole restaurant was filthy. There was puddles of soda that were stagnant under the soda machine, fruit flies all over it and next to the salad. In fact, my friend had a fruit fly sitting on her cup that hopped on her hand and just sat there staring at her. It didn't even fly away. That's how comfortable and at home these flies were. 

Anyway, pictures are attached to get your own idea of what an infested junk yard this restaurant is. There were webs and dust all over the walls and floors and ceiling. Soda and food stains everywhere. It smelt like mold. Trash under the tables.

The facilities are not the best, but they are fine.  The practice rooms are nice enough.  The locker room could use some TLC.

But the real problem is the instructors.  Others have identified this as ""competitive"".  I wouldn't call it that.  But there does seem to be an approach to motivating that is rote.  Some are ""militant"".  But my impression is that their focus is on technicalities and they try to ""motivate"" by yelling.  Its like how you get a kid to squeal when you are pushing them on a swing.  ""Isn't this fun!  Wee!!""

I love Bikram because the repetition of the movements (its always the same movements) allows me to find my own focus and concentrate on finding new places in each pose.

I keep getting a response from the employees like ""call at this time"", or ""he will be in at this time"". It's been a week and a half and I still cannot get in contact with someone who can help me. 

If I would have taken my time I could have waited a week for an online order to come through...and they would have taken returns if the item was defective. 
But I thought I'd give a local business the benefit of the doubt. As you can see the option is to always shop online.",0

They advertise it as a complete creation and then charge you extra for it. That's just ridiculous also not being able to consume dairy means your paying extra again. =(,0
352741,1,"Let's start with the dirty environment and the ghetto attitude customer service. I ordered XL pizza and a side of fries. 30 minuets later, I got my shitty doughy pizza that contains one full liter of cooking oil that I squeezed into small bottles of water just so I can use it to cook my chicken wings tomorrow night when my aunt Jamilah comes to visit because I know she likes em extra fried hard. And of course there was no fries because the lady forgot I asked for the fries as she forgot I said XL and gave me a Large instead. I went inside again asking her where my fries is and she ignored me. She said I wasn't charged for it so I didn't have to worry!! But I wanted to pay and I wanted my fries. Here I am writing this review that I thought it will count but then realized this place only rated 3 stars anyways so it can't be any worse than that.

When it first opened I never went here without wanting to give it a 5/5 for the quality of the food, but in the last few months it's gone downhill. The desserts have become heavy and artificial-tasting, and the main dishes have less flavor overall. I don't know if they had a turnover in the kitchen staff or if the ones they have are experiencing burnout, but my last two dining experiences here have been severely lacking. I will say that despite that, the service continues to be excellent and the waitstaff is charming and attentive.",0

First, upon entering we got to watch an employee eat his food behind the counter and over other food while making some folks dinner. We order, move down to get veggies, I go to get drinks while my boy friend is grabbing the pitas. I see not one, but TWO cockroaches scurry behind/under the drink machine. There was another half of a cockroach that was dead and under the front of the drink machine (visible from the table where we sat). Trash was everywhere on tables and covering the floor.

I came here once, and wasn't impressed at all. I'm not sure if they have something that they're really known for, but we tried a few dishes, nothing special.

We ordered a small order of seafood soondubu, VERY MEH considering I've been to Jong Ga Jib (in Northeast Philly) which has the most delicious soondubu. The soondubu at Beawon came out lukewarm, not very hot, and really plain and not spicy enough. The bulgolgi was very so so, they cooked in the kitchen, maybe that was our mistake. My parents didn't enjoy it very much, but I thought it was okay. We also ordered the seafood pancake type dish, that wasn't all that great. It highly resembled the Chinese pizza.

All in all, Korean food is pricy, and for paying that much, I kind of expected better food. I love korean food, but this place didn't really fix my cravings at the moment. I MIGHT give it another shot, but I know my parents aren't trying to come back anytime soon.",0
2828087,1,"We stopped in for a bite to eat on Friday night after attending a Phantoms game at the PPL Center. We arrived at 10 p.m. and they sat us down to eat. They were prompt with their service but we're in too much of a rush to push us out the door since they literally close at 11 p.m. They had to substitute our rice because they already threw out whatever rice they had left. Our waitress stopped by with our bill way before we were done eating and asked us to pay up as soon as possible because they wanted to close out the cash register. We paid the bill and continued to eat, however; various individuals of the wait staff stopped by the table to take the billfold as it had our change hanging out of it. I finally took the change and receipt out of it and put it on another table. The food was fine but I like to sit back and enjoy the food and company I am with so if you want to be closed by 11 p.m. then stop seating customers at 9 p.m. to allow your customers time to enjoy the food you prepared and yourselves enough time to get cleaned up. We were good enough for you to seat us and for you to take our money but not good enough to enjoy the food you prepared. Thank you for the horrible experience. It is a shame as the food was pretty good BUT your crappie service left a horrible taste in my mouth.",0

Note they had plenty of spots open to seat people because the next 5 partys got seated in a booth before me. Now it this point i was like hey maybe they had a rough day whatever rolling it off my shoulders. So once I was seated after a 30 min wait in the rain because they said no one can wait in there lobby due to cdc rules.  The bar tender had to wait on me instead  a waiter or waitress. This place has went down hill so bad if you like food that taste like it was sitting out for hours. I don't like talking about businesses in a negative way but maybe this will help them realize they need to make a change or help the next victim they claim with there service and   very poor dishes.,0

Apparently writing things down as a they are ordered is too difficult as a waiter. I'm live two blocks away. Let's say this is the last chance I'm giving this place. You hire inept employees you, unsatisfactory reviews will follow.  As we ordered and ask questions our waiter was, well quick, to snip a response. What's your soup du jour? You say it's one that's already on the menu? Well, that's not really a soup of the day that's just a soup you already have prepared, or the lazy way of not preparing a soup of the day!  Secondly, if the waiter messes up the order, ""I can't have carbs"" and I order accordingly, and you bring out nothing like I ordered please don't be surprised by this review. Secondly, a manager came out and tried to tell me you can't serve liver and onions with out gravy! Actually you can. Just dont out he gravy on it. Admit your mistake and fix it. I ordered no potatoes or gravy, the item I ordered doesn't require that to be consumed, so why tell me it does? Liver seems to go down with out gravy just fine, why would argue with a guest? Management doesn't need to discuss why I can't have gravy. Just serve what I ordered the way I ordered it. Would you argue with someone whom has a peanut allergy. I can't have white flour. Don't serve me what I haven't ordered and tell me that it was made wrong, here you go enjoy. That seems, well, not truly customer satisfactory! Everyone has a day and let's just hope today was yours. Either way the one star was well deserved. Til next time",0
4129547,2,"I was excited about maybe not having to go out to Charlotte Ave. to get pho, but this place was terribly disappointing. We got beef pho, a banh mi, and some spring rolls, and each of them was lacking in their core ingredients.

For me, pho is all about the broth. It should be meaty, rich, and spiced in a way that complements rather than distracts from the main ingredient. Theirs checked none of those boxes. There was no meatiness, no body, not enough salt, and the overwhelming taste was of star anise.  

The fillings on the banh mi were perfectly adequate, but the bread tasted like a standard wheat-based roll, not the light crispy crackly rice flour roll that makes a banh mi a banh mi.

The fillings on the spring rolls were, again, perfectly adequate, but that wasn't enough to rescue them from a gummy wrapper. 

I'd pay good money to have one of the Charlotte pho joints closer to my home, but the prices here are double what you'd pay out in West Nashville or at Interasian for far superior food. Love Peace and Pho just isn't worth it.",0
4841963,1,"Avoid Sesame Place like the plague, especially if you have a child with Autism.  I cannot begin to tell you how many things are wrong with this park, but here's my experience from my short hour and a half inside the park today before saying adios.  And know this, they WILL refund your money if you complain enough about your experience to Guest Services, despite the continued insistence that they can't.  If you have a poor experience put your foot down and don't take no for an answer.  I'd be even angrier if I knew I put ten cents in this greedy company's pockets.

This small, lackluster and unorganized park didn't open at 10 AM as they were supposed to, rather it was closer to 10:45 AM since they had no First Aid employees report to work.  Fun times spending 45 minutes in the 86 degree sun with an 8-year old special needs child.  Spent the next 15 minutes in the line that crept along, so yes, starting our day 1-hour later than expected.

For a park that claims to be autism-friendly you'd think they'd have a staffing plan that allows them to actually open on time so parents can help their kids keep themselves together.  Not Sesame Place, they instead have a downtrodden looking woman with a two-way radio who walks up and down the line yelling to people ""we're on a delayed opening today - no one in First Aid so we can't open"".

So once in the park and sweating from the hour long wait in the sun my son wants to go in the ""wave pool"".  Well, if you took their website literally when they say they have a wave pool then that's on you because they have neither waves nor a pool.  Their wave pool is literally ankle deep.  Don't take my word for it, Google that one.  In fact, there isn't even a pool in this park!  The closest thing to a pool is the lazy river which had a line 150-200 people deep, and after you go around once they make you get out and get back in line!  Hope you enjoyed that tease, get back in line and enjoy the now 88 degree sun.

I honestly don't even want to go on, the rest of the story is a tedious account of how many detached people I had to talk to before I could finally speak to someone who had a clue, and honestly that never happened.  My favorite employee was the girl at the ticket counter who listened to my list of things wrong with the park from a special needs parent's perspective who said ""I can't offer you a refund but I can give you free passes to come back.  Hello?????   I'm shocked this park even has 2-stars on Yelp.  Best guess is that it's a result of the fact that you can't give zero stars, and maybe some 5-star reviews by their management.

4169338,1,"I never write reviews like most people, though my experience with this company has actually motivated me to go out of my way to make sure other people don't fall into the same trap I did.

I was a member at this club for a few months until I had to move away for work. I told the front desk people (actually expecting the typical fitness club BS that you have to talk to a manager in person before cancelling etc etc etc) that I wanted to cancel and they actually didn't say that. Instead, they told me that all was well and my membership would be cancelled. I was charged again the following month. Ok, mistakes happen, so I called them to let them know and they said again ""we'll take care of this."" I was charged AGAIN the following TWO months until I finally decided to make a stop-payment with my bank.

The first month that they didn't receive their money, they followed up with me explaining that I had a past-due balance of $120..... wait a second, $120???? The front desk people looked me in my eyes and told me that I was free and clear, membership was cancelled, and didn't need to do anything else.

They lied. Avoid this club at all costs. Normally I don't go out of my way to steer people away from businesses, but this experience has been incredibly frustrating for no reason, only other than the incompetence that runs this establishment.

2757792,2,"Recently heard about this novel concept of having a meal and seat-side service while you enjoy a movie and was pretty excited to check this out.

Went to a Sunday matinee showing.  Signage at the mall was sufficient for us to fairly easily locate the correct place to park to be close to the theater.

The first room you enter has a beautiful seating arrangement along with a fully stocked bar, giving it a really cool vibe for a theater.

We had booked online (paying a $3 ""convenience"" fee, which is kinda lame, I guess more relevant if you're going during a busy time when a sell-out is more likely)

The seats were comfortable and the theater appeared clean without sticky floors (although the escalators going down to the bathrooms were very sticky).  Each seat is padded along with padded armrests that each contain a cupholder, and there's a swing-out tray for you to enjoy your meal on.  The tray is fairly tiny, but sufficient for the meals we had.

There is a red button you can push for service.  Our server was friendly, but he was trying too hard to joke and be likeable and kinda came off creepy, and just hung around too long.

We ordered the crispy chicken tenders and a bbq bacon burger under their 2 for $25 plan (which included an appetizer, we got the pretzel bites)

The pretzel bites were delicious and arrived in a timely fashion.  I enjoyed an adult spiked shake (the orange dreamsicle) and you could definitely taste the alcohol (and for $8.50 you better!) and my wife had a chocolate shake.  Both were delicious.

I had customized my burger order with a number of items being left off, but when our food was delivered my burger was not as I had ordered and I had to send it back (didn't notice until the server had left, and it wasn't my original server, so I had to press my service button and wait for someone to return).  My wifes chicken tenders were tasty, the fries were just ok.

When my burger finally came back it was as ordered, and was just ok tasting, nothing special.

They come around near the end of the movie to drop off your check.  I had pre-authorized with my credit card so I could just sign and go at the end.  But my check looked like it was too high.  Upon checking it further I discovered that they had charged me for the ""2nd burger"" that was delivered because they had messed up on my original order.

So once again I had to press the service button and wait for someone to come and take the check back to fix it.

All-in-all, this is a great concept that I had high hopes for, but it just fell flat for us.  Can only rate two stars as we were pretty disappointed with the overall hassle.",0
5259220,2,"Being a grown-up Hulkamaniac, when I found out that Hulk Hogan had opened up a store in Clearwater Beach, I knew that one day I would have to make my way out there to this supposed Mecca of Hulkamania.  That day finally came, and I arrived to Clearwater Beach, only to discover that I was way too early, and had to wait two hours until it opened.  But that was fine, because I saw a golden opportunity to try some place new to get some breakfast.

I walked past several places, like the two different Frenchy's, and a place humorously called ""Cooter's,"" but ultimately what drew me to Clear Sky's was the fact that they had a patio filled with people, and was the only place that looked like it was open on a weekday morning.

I was able to get a patio seat pretty quickly which was nice, and the day was comfortable and beautiful, so I had a general plan to eat breakfast, and kill the two hours with perhaps a Bloody Mary or two after my meal, while watching people and relaxing.  Unfortunately, that's not exactly how things worked out in the end.

Nobody treated me poorly at the restaurant; the hostess and my server were both nice, but the service itself left a lot to be desired.  It was simply just slow.  It took a little while to get my coffee ordered, then my food ordered.  My coffee cup sat empty longer than I would have preferred.

And then there was the food itself; seeing a place as well occupied as when I first arrived, I would honestly have hoped for the food to have been better.  I ordered their burrito sonora, which was supposed to have sausage in it, as well as eggs, onions and cheese, but for the life of me, I had a difficult time in finding any sausage at all.  The ""green chili avocado sauce"" that was supposed to be on it looked like, and tasted like plain mashed avocado, and was already brown and oxidized when it was brought to the table.  Needless to say, I've had many better breakfast burritos than Clear Sky's.

After the meal, I still had some time to kill; my friend ordered a beer, but it never came.  The check did however, so it was at this point where we decided that perhaps we should take our drinking endeavors somewhere else; and from our seat on the patio, we could see that Frenchy's was just opening up.

I can't say I'd come back here when my travels bring me back out to Clearwater for more Hulkamania or baseball spring training, and I'd implore caution to other tourists who tend to wear the rose-colored glasses that vacationing tourists tend to and might end up getting a mediocre breakfast burrito if they're not careful.",0

1320464,1,"Nashville Repertory Theatre performance of ""A Christmas Story.""  I will start out by stating that it is very disappointing that once you arrive at TPAC, there are multiple lines to purchase snacks and drinks and after you purchase the overpriced items, you are told that you can not bring them into the theater.  Specifically the Nashville Repertory Theater.  We were stopped at the lobby and told we could not enter when people in front of us were allowed through to the elevator with drinks and then people behind us.  We said if others are being allowed through then we should as well.  The woman monitoring entry allowed us to get to the elevators.  As soon as we got to the floor of the theatre, we met another woman that told us we could not have the snacks and drinks.  When we said that should be told to us before we spend money on overpriced items and she said a message was scrolling on the menu.  By the way, another concessions station was open outside the theatre doors. We finally threw $32 worth of snacks away and went into a very sub-standard performance.  It was such a frustrating night and poor production that we left the performance at intermission and decided we will never again go to a Nashville Repertory Performance.  We have attended many broadway performances at TPAC; which have all been excellent, however, Nashville Repertory is not worth the money and this incident with Snacks is nothing more that a way to ""Rip-Off"" patrons.  #skipnashvillerepertory",0

The roll was good, not great, but a typical cheap roll. The fish used for the rest of the sushi was not very fresh at all.  The salmon was okay. They included white tuna on the combo, which is one of the worst fish for you (banned in many countries). The tuna was mushy and mealy, and I actually could not bring myself to eat it and ended up spitting it out.  The rice used was cheap, hard, bland rice. However, the wasabi had a great zing to it! Overall the sushi was worse than some cheap, fast food sushi places I have been to.

The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their meals, especially the cold yakisoba. I'm the only one who got a 100% sushi meal, so maybe their cooked food it better.

Seemed like a joke... the beef skewer was supposed to be ribeye -- but so grissly and cold when it arrived.  Very disappointing - - would not recommend.  

Decided to split their 'famous' wagyu burger, to be cooked medium rare... First one came out, tough like a chew toy.... Second one was fine - -  nothing spectacular, nothing special.. Many other burger places around here including Habit does a better tasting burger... Wouldn't recommend this item either.  Our server seemed jumpy and couldn't possibly put anybody in a relaxed mode... not sure if this was due to a language issue, or just his personality.  

I don't get how this place gets 4.5 stars in this town.  Won't be going back.  This is not a Tomas or Stella Mare calibre type of place.  Sorry.",0
6186259,1,"Sorry not sorry. HORRIBLE. Just went last night, to start, the AC doesn't work, now that being said, it was quite comfortable with the 50 million fans they had going. The salad is chopped lettuce only with bottled dressing. The steaks were grissly. I guess when I order a 30 dollar steak I'd like to be able to eat it. Our waiter had a baseball hat on backwards, T-shirt and blue jeans.....sorry to bother you sir!  It was just awful. On the up side, they saw we didn't eat our steaks and took them off the bill, that was great and they asked us to come back and try them again.....I can't, it was just that bad.",0
3229151,1,"After I placed the order, I was given a phone call from the restaurant telling me that the kitchen was closed due to maintenance issues, and they couldn't make or deliver the food. 

The guy said that he was going to try and put through a refund. The refund never happened, and when I followed up with yelp as to where this refund was, the restaurant denied having received the order, even though I have been charged. 

Extremely disappointing on behalf of both yelp and this dishonest restaurant!",0
5629592,2,"We got a Groupon. First impressions are everything! This place needs to be cleaned up.  The restroom speaks volumes(very dirty). The place from the outside very nice.  But once inside different story.  Although he knowledge of wine was good he was quite not a friendly person, kinda rude!  Is not like he was giving the wine tasting for free!  The wine tasting was ok I've been to others so this by far was the best! I will not be back once was enough for me.  Everything is very old & dirty looking.  I really don't know how they have functions there with the place needing up keeping & that toilet is so dirty!  You get a small glass you do the wine tasting. And 1 or 2 bottles depending on what your wine tasting includes.  The best is the tips go to charity instead of the place.  I gave this place 2 stars because presentation is everything! And my group agreed with me.",0

Her teeth had gotten so bad due to her refusal to let me brush, spray, or perform any kind of dental care on her. Sigh... I'm really glad the vet was open and honest about her medical needs. I was able to get her in fairly quickly. I was a nervous Fur Mom, but the staff, although young and a bit goofy, was able to answer all my questions and took care of my ornery bundle of joy. I would definitely take her back. You can't beat the low cost. I went early in the morning on a week day, so the wait wasn't bad at all.",1

Everything was cooked just as I ordered and the house sauce is so smokey that it goes perfectly with anything, the mac and cheese was the right amount of gooey and the bread crumbs on top, a big plus.  Food was ready in under 10 minutes, and service was very friendly. While I was a bit bummed they do not let you order over the phone for pick up, I was very satisfied that they were able to get everything prepared so fast.

733317,4,"Like any consignment store, there are deals to be found.  However, you must be prepared to sift through all of the racks in order to find them.

I've been going to this particular Greene Street location for years.  Sometimes luck is on my side, other times, it can feel like a wasted trip.  But those times when I do find some hidden treasure make every trip worth it.

You won't find vintage items here, but what you will find are name-brand items, some worn, some new, for a fraction of the price you'd pay in the actual store.  I religiously find brands like J.Crew, Ann Taylor and Express here.  Prices are sometimes worth it, depending on what you're looking for.  No, I won't pay $9 for an H&M shirt that probably had an original cost of $12 and has been worn, but I will happily fork over $15 for a non-worn Ann Taylor loft blouse.  

They have a clearance section and an awesome shoe selection as well.  My only gripe is that the dressing rooms are, well, see-through.  That aside, a great place to get professional looking clothes on a budget.",1

The breakfast my friend and I ordered was absolutely amazing. I'm a sucker for any kind of breakfast sandwich, and theirs was ridiculously delicious. And make sure you order the bacon. So. Good. It's cash only for delivery, but that's no surprise for New Orleans. And they were pretty quick compared to a lot of other restaurants that deliver  in the area.

The workers actually start setting up your table so when you get to the front of the line you have a place to sit. We tried everything on the menu between our table and it was all fantastic. The frito pie was really great too. 

My only recc is that if you take a taxi here, its very difficult to get a taxi back to your hotel. We called several taxi services and they wouldn't help us so we ended up having to call the actual hotel and have them send a taxi to get us.",1

6632613,4,"Do you like your pizza well done and overflowing with delicious high quality toppings? If you said yes then you should be eating at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. In the world of ""gourmet pizza,"" Anthony's ranks very high. While still a fairly new restaurant on the Delaware scene, they boast 2 locations in the small state. The first being in the Brandywine Market Square on Concord Pike and the newer location in Pike Creek.  They use a Coal Fired oven to cook their pizzas, as well of a lot of their other menu items. The flavor this adds is amazing.

I had the pleasure of dining at the Concord Pike location and must say the experience was highly enjoyable. The atmosphere is not what you would expect of a pizza joint, its kind of dark and intimate. The walls are adorned with flat screen televisions and pictures of everyone from Don Corleone to John Lennon. There is always good music playing overhead that's just loud enough that you can enjoy it, but soft enough as to not ruin your conversation. The staff at Anthony's is great. They always take great care of me when I am there. They are friendly, attentive, and efficient.

Lets talk about Pizza. As I was once told by the Manager there, they believe in light sauce, light cheese, and heavy on the toppings. That and the fact that it is WELL done paints a great picture of what to expect. The specialty pies thy have there are really good and probably not what you are used to. Most recently I had the Broccoli Rabe and Sausage Pizza, and the Caramelized Cauliflower Pizza(pictured).

Lets start with the Broccoli Rabe and sausage. This is one of my favorite pies at Anthony's. It is a great mixture of all the ingredients. The tomato sauce is nice. It's not too thick but also not watery. There is a delicious layer of melted cheese, and plenty of Broccoli Rabe and italian sausage on top. The bitterness of the greens works really well with the mild sweetness of the sausage.

The Caramelized Cauliflower Pizza is not a standard menu item at Anthony's. I believe it is only currently available at the Concord Pike Location. I gotta tell you, RUN to Anthony's and try this pizza immediately! I have never enjoyed eating cauliflower this much. This is a pizza that does not have tomato sauce on it. The texture and flavor of the cauliflower is really surprising and the roasted garlic that is on it is to die for. I really hope this pie makes it on the permanent menu because everyone should get to try this pizza.

We also were able to try their Chicken Wings today. These, like the pizza, are cooked in the coal-fired oven. Once again, Anthony's did not disappoint. They were great. You wont find these wings covered in sauce, nor will they burn your mouth. They taste like they are drizzled with olive oil and rosemary and cooked in the oven until the outside is crispy and flavorful.

As great as everything was at Anthony's, I will say there are 2 things that are a little disappointing. The first is the price. These pizzas are a little on the expensive side. A large specialty pie is going to run you just over $19. A large plain cheese pie is about $14. (A Large pie is roughly 16"") The other is beverages. While they do have a full bar, and some nights the have a special where a bottle or Peroni is only $1.50, you might only want a soda or iced tea. They do not have fountain drinks here. If you order a coke, you get a small bottle of coke and a glass of ice. If you order an iced tea, you get a bottle of Gold Peak tea and a glass of ice. Refills are not free. This, on top of the pies can add up pretty quick so be mindful. Lastly, it's not really a place I would take my kids to. At least not yet. This is absolutely no fault of Anthony's, I just think my kids would prefer a pizza place with a large mouse and a ball pit.

All in all, I think Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza has some truly amazing pies, excellent wings, and an awesome group of people working there. While they may not be my choice for family night out, I can definitely see taking my wife here for a date night, or meeting up with some friends and splitting a pie.",1
2681566,4,Bright cheery service & they checked to ensure the food was brought out at the right temperature.  Seems like duck is their specialty.  My kale salad was very large & I added chicken.  I wish there was a little more chicken in it.  Duck quesadillas seemed that be a big hit - I'll try that next to me & I like that it's right next to the United gates.,1
3315335,5,"These Guys are Good!

I have attended more than one Dinner Detective show by now and they're  really professional and funny.  Most of all, they care.  Sometimes, for instance, one of the actors is embedded in the wait staff and isn't really a waiter.  But since they're playing the role, they accommodate a guest's request like extra bread, butter or decaf.

The host gets the show started and whips up the energy and enthusiasm in the audience.  Suddenly, someone comes in stabbed complete with knife and blood, staggers all over the place and flops down on the ground.  They then scootch over to the ""chalk mark"" outline of a body on the floor to fit within it.  That gag tells you they're not really hurt and just having fun with you.

Two dysfunctional, funny detectives suddenly burst in and attempt to gather clues to solve the murder.  They interview audience members and produce ""clues"" that are shared with each table to help you solve the crime.  

There are actors posing as guests at the tables and you don't know who's who because everyone wears a gag name tag that they write.  Eventually, the actors are outed because they either end up dead or fight with each other. 

A multi-course meal is served between acts including appetizers, salad, entree and dessert.  Drinks are available at a private cash bar.

There is a $100 value prize to the person who not only guesses the murderer but best describes the steps leading up to it.  It's not easy but my wife got close once.

I will bring more friends to Dinner Detective for 3 hilarious hours next time I visit.",1

5244608,4,"Suburban Station holds a special place in my heart.  I understand this is an odd statement, but it does.  Before I moved to the city I was taking the R5 to and from Suburban everyday and became a huge fan of the musical performers throughout the concourse.  Sure it has several underground food stands, a Duncan Donuts and even a Dollar Tree, but what makes it great is the music which echoes throughout the long hallways.

On a day I was feeling particularly annoyed at the thought of work, I heard the booming of voice of Lionel Ritchie singing ""Easy"" with the accompaniment of a Casio keyboard.  As I approached the sound, it turned out not to be Lionel, but the voice was still great and it made my day.  Take a trip through Suburban someday you have free time and let the music guide you.  

**Do not miss the guy who plays Johnny Cash through a speaker and occasionally strums a guitar and sings along.  I dare you not to smile.",1
2700893,4,"Definitely a dive, but one of my favorite South Street bars. I love the decor, especially the graffiti upstairs. The food is nothing special, typical greasy bar fare, but it's pretty cheap and they have fun things like pierogies and tater tots. 

They have a late afternoon happy hour, as most places do, but they also have an evening happy hour from 10-11 pm. They have a pretty good draft selection and also have cheap specials on cans of PBR Pounders.  We've never had a problem getting a table downstairs and they have pool tables upstairs. It's usually a pretty chill environment and a fun, young crowd.

My only complaint is that one of the regular bartenders prides himself on being kind of a jerk to the patrons. I've experienced this on a few different occasions. He's sarcastic and condescending... not in a playful, funny way either. We were sitting at the bar and he jumped into our conversation and instantly began belittling and debating with my boyfriend. I dig it when the bartenders show some personality and joke around, but if you're working for tips, don't be an ass! Avoid that guy's area (I'm sure you'll know him instantly) and you'll have a great time.",1
245359,4,"No signage, no overt markings it's even a restaurant until you pass by and peek in. Only visible markings are the hanging flower pots on the exterior. Started with chips and salsa with pretty standard ingredients, seemed to use sweet tomatoes but not overly sweet just changed the standard flavor. Chips were homemade style which were thicker and crispier then the norm. Appetizer was the quesadilla which was good for two and had calabasas inside served with black beans. I chose the asada and carnitas tacos and they were also very good served on homemade corn tortillas. To sum it up it's more of a gourmet Mexican restaurant that has a rustic industrial design and what appeared to be a good selection of tequila and mescal. Sat down, ate lunch and returned to work in an hour so good for lunch as well.",1

2271762,4,"How lucky we are to live nearby!  I wasn't sure about Beer Revolution, just another average brewpub? It turned out to be much better than average.  

I love the concept, the menu of rotating beers with 4 beers on special at 4pm, and a new keg opened every Friday at 5.  And as someone who makes strong positive associations with airports, I love the display, which shows where the beer originates, how much is available, when it was tapped and the estimated date it will run out.

We shared a crab cake louis salad, and a 10"" blazing saddle pizza.  It was a lot of food even for two people (beer is filling, mind you).  There were 3 crab cakes with the salad, and they were delicious!  It was undoubtedly tinned crab, but most times one has crab cakes anywhere they are bready and dry, and these ones were moist very tasty, as well as the size of hockey pucks.  We both really enjoyed the salad.  Similarly, it was good we got the smaller size pizza, because it was enough for two people plus.  The pizza was really good, better than average.

The service was OK, and I think I could give this place 4.5 stars based on our experience. I can see how it could get loud but we were there at about 3pm when it was quiet, we could watch the eastern conference game, enjoy some unique beers and some very good food in peace.  We'll be back :)",1

My pancakes were overdone and tough (I know, I should have sent them back), my sister's jambalaya had plenty of rice and very little meat, and my friend's chicken fried steak was almost floating in gravy.  OK so maybe they were having an off day, so I decided to make myself happy with dessert...oooo, Orange Walnut Bread Pudding sounds delish...so I ordered it, sans ice cream, to go.  My jaw dropped when the server brought this teeny tiny take-out cup.  For $5.50, I wasn't expecting a gigantic serving but that was SO disappointing!

I literally searched for the sugar plum pastry everywhere and couldn't find it and came here and got it two times here in a row! They are all out now though (limited special item). One day when I arrived, there was a mishap and they forgot all about my drink. I waited patiently, and finally went to remind them. They were apologetic. I was not in a hurry, if I had been I'd have been annoyed probably but it wasn't a big deal for me. It did however make me decide to come a couple more times before reviewing them to make sure I didn't rate them poorly if they didn't deserve it. I have since maintained an otherwise good experience with them, so I feel I can give them the 3/4 stars. This has been my new favorite location. I think that's for personal preference really.

The food, however was excellent, my wife's salmon salad was excellent, although I prefer warm salmon, the cold salmon was fine. what was awesome was her spinach, candied pecans, goat cheese and beet portion of the salad. it was awesome.  I got the lunch BBQ sampler, which was very tasty on their pretzel rolls.  potato chips were also excellent.",1
3933925,3,"I want to like this place, but after 2 kinda messed up manicures I'll only go back for pedis. It's nice, clean and new. They put liners for sanitary reasons which is a plus. However the two manicures that I've had were just not good. Your nail beds should not hurt after gel, dip or whatever gets applied. Period. Also, a manicure is the grooming of the nails, cuticles and skin surrounding. They literally just used the electric files to trim my cuticles, slap some lotion on and called it a ""manicure"" Again, great pedicure. Not so great manicure experience. IMO",1

5591717,5,"Okay--I am conflicted:  Emma is a genius, but don't I want to keep her for myself?

 I have strange hair--parts are frizzy, parts are wavy, parts are dead straight, parts are thin, parts are thick.  Faced with my hair, most stylists just give me a bob, which inevitably looks frumpy, helmet-y, and generally unappealing.

But Emma!  My goodness:  she took one look and said, ""Let me get in there.""  She took time to talk to me about my life and my preferences.  Then she gave me the haircut of my dreams--easy to style but with potential for variety, looks good no matter what.  She gave me great home coloring advice too.

After a few days, I realized that I needed some instruction on how to best style my hair (having had bobs all my life, I really didn't know what to do with this cool new hair).  Emma had me come in, showed me some options, and without charging me, tweaked the style a bit for me and then gave me a fun styling that I could easily do at home.  She gave me some expert tips and sent me on my way with a smile on my face.  Oh, my husband is ecstatic.

The salon is a beautiful space, but Emma is the heart.  She is a natural and she has fantastic technique.  She's not chatty (but VERY personable), so if you don't want to talk while your hair is getting cut, just let her do her work.  She doesn't push products but she is very helpful about how to use the products you have.  Go to Emma! You will be so happy!

Yes, the price is on par with some of the fancier salons.  But it is worth it--which is a lot more than I can say for those other places.  Save your pennies if you have to!",1
2114796,5,"My wife and I were excited to go see the new movie about Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. We were able to quickly and easily book our tickets for Landmark Ritz 5 through the Atom films app. Tickets were $8.00a piece. 
Landmark Ritz 5 does not have on-site parking however, there is a parking garage only 2 blocks from them that they validate for. Parking costs $11.00 once validated.
From the outside the theater looks old and a bit run down. On the inside it's definitely a dated theatre but it has a nice look, is well cared for, and the staff is friendly and helpful. Concessions prices were reasonable. We ordered a large popcorn and large soda and paid $13.00. The purchase of a large item gets you 1 refill per item. 
The theater seats recline and are comfortable. The sound and screen size were nice too.
In total this is a great movie theatre to go to that offers independent films you won't see in most theaters at a very good price. You won't get the bells and whistles you will at mainstream theaters but you will get a very good and comfortable experience.",1

But the stars of the show tonight were the mac and cheese side and the grilled carrot side.  The carrots were so tasty and cooked to a crisp perfection. The mac and cheese was rich but not overwhelmingly so. A great balance of flavor in what elsewhere would have been a heavy dish.

The pizza looked great almost too good to eat. Like it was fake. Well it was. The bread was the whole slice. The cheese looked fake. And there was way too much sauce. Then my friends and I went to Mama rosas pizza and got it by the slice. Basically heaven in my mouth. This pizza is so good it's not even funny. The employees are so sweet I cannot say anything better about this pizza. Keep in mind my roommate is from New York and she doesn't put up with no bs.,1

We arrived without a reservation on a Wednesday night (mistake) but they were able to squeeze us in.  The menu is limited but there was a variety of choices to appeal to all.  my coworker and I ended up insisting on sharing our food with each other since we both thought our meal was the best.  And we were both right.  The mole sauce was spectacular!!  Everything was fresh, the flavors so distinct.  The cocktail was a very smooth high end margarita.  Oh and then when we barely could breathe, we had to try dessert.  A vegan chocolate cinnamon mole cupcake and a gluten free cheesecake that was so unique and wonderful I couldn't stop eating it!",1

We stopped in for a late lunch, early dinner.
With a Yelp check in you get a free ear of corn that has been grilled, and has some cheese on top.
The corn was so tender and full of flavor.
I ordered chicken fajitas as a entree. The fajitas came with four tortillas, sour cream, beans and cheese.
The fajitas were made up of chicken, onions, bell peppers and peppers.
The flavor was ok, but on the bland side. Nothing really jumped out at me.
They were just ok. Can not say I would return.",1

Avlos has some big shoes to full replacing the iconic Majolica that was a mainstay in the Phoenixville food scene for the last 15 years. We have been twice and have generally been pleased. Overall, the food has been great with highlights being the lamb chops, octopus, and others apps. The one disappointment was an attempt at avgolemeno soup which was more like bland chicken soup than anything else. Offsetting that was a wonderful Talapia fish special.  Where Avlos needs note refinement was in the service which was OK the first time and pretty awful on our second visit.  Entrees came out late, food was cold, and opening our bottle of wine required multiple people.  The restaurant was also per full on it second visit and was very loud -- they need to add some acoustics controls!
Avlos has tasty Greek food and great potential. I hope they can improve their service and deal with the noise level.",1

3814843,3,"Man, I wish I could give 12 South Taproom more stars. Maybe I will eventually check them out for dinner, and I can report back. 

The reason I give them only 3 stars is because they took one of my favorite favorite lunch spots and transformed it. I don't personally know the owners, but they are great people. They also own Rumours and Rumours East, I believe. I would see the husband in the store all the time, and he's very nice. 

So, sorry. Only three stars. There's nothing wrong with three stars, is there? It was just easier when it was the market-type place even sans groceries. You moved through the counter to order and then paid when you were done. Very easy on the customer. Now they have table service, which is fine. It was just a wee bit slow the last time I was in for lunch even though there weren't that many tables. My waitress was probably the only person working, but it always fascinates me when there are few tables and slow service. It's next door to the crowded Mafioso's, so maybe if that's too long a wait, check out 12 South Taproom?

Oh, and the food is good (it still doesn't seem as good as before though!). Maybe if they brought back some of those great sandwiches they used to have. I had a very nice pork sandwich last time I was in for lunch. I can recommend that highly if they still have it.

Honestly, I'm glad 12 South Taproom is still around, and if the owners had to shake things up to keep the doors open, I understand.",1

3674854,5,"Yes. Just go here. Don't even look at pictures anymore because they don't do the food justice.

Waited for 15 minutes on a Friday night to be seated. Immediately got a pot of tea (which was great btw, not too hot, not too herb-y and bitter). The menu has tons of food if you're not into just dim sum. We ordered pork buns, chicken feet (holy moly those babies were huge), the shrimp noodle thing that everyone likes, spicy xlb, rice in the leaf (which only comes in one btw but if you're going with another person you can easily split it), and the pork belly bao buns. All were bomb. I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly bc it felt a little too fatty for me, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. We didn't think we'd finish it all because it was all served at once, but it was delicious. 

The place was packed, but there's a lot of room. Bathrooms were clean as well. Customer service was great; even if there was a full house, there was always someone asking us if we needed anything.


Just go. You won't regret it. If you do, I'll eat your left over dim sum.",1

Falafel Hummus is perfect for that.
The prices are hard to beat and the food very satisfying.

The juice drinks are one-of-a-kind and must be tried.
Oh, also the mint lemonade, I think. So refreshing.

3314421,3,"Consistent , reliable bar food in a great location. Grabbing dinner there first week of December 2012, I had wings and bison burger with the crew. I guess the new issue for us is the balance of diners with younger kids and the new shuffleboard device, that spans the front bar area. I support local business all the way, but this addition seems well intoned but a fail. First, in dinner hour, folks awaiting seating with hungry kids, gravitated to the table game. And as it sits very low, and runs the entire west wall almost, it's a total magnet for the kids. And if I was a weary parent with kids in tow, I would let the, throw the puck and woop it up. But, with Six and ten year olds screaming as we ate, and no other tables ready..we were trapped. The table is nice I suppose but if I was hoping to draw patrons and maximize revenue, I would weigh out the lost seating and the minimal cash flow such a huge device might generate. I can't believe the servers recoup much tip income from the lost seats that vanished with this addition. That and a very hearty air conditioner that blows over the front bar tables and diners, means we will seriously debate a night time return. Overall the foods really good, the servers are prompt and friendly and I am torn on the need for the shuffleboard.,not sure who they expect to sit adjacent to frenzied kids, and arctic air in December...I guess my mistake for skipping a hooded sweatshirt and earplugs.. But these minor matters are easily adjusted if the management ever gets serious about details and acoustics. One star for front bar ambience...but get the bison ...and a cold beer ..and sit way away from the babysitting crowd...actually..now that I think about it..our other time in the way back was derailed with screaming kids and too many balloons...again..this is an imperfect world..and I support parents and businesses...ugh.. Can they put vodka in kiddy cocktails after dark?.",1

We always take in our aluminum after it's stripped/clean. It's great their huge white poster boards are posted so you don't constantly have to ask the prices.

We had lots of fun watching people learning how to salsa. The instructor was pretty good and made sure the participants were having fun. Once the lessons were over, the dance floor was open to all. The first song was one of salsa's classic hits but then after that, they played too much bachata (salsa social ?) and played none of the classic or current salsa hits. We were there until closing and only heard one merengue, and not even one reggaeton. I have better salsa on my iPhone. Go and enjoy, buy be prepared to hear as much bachata as salsa.",1

Through their marketing, I've been able to lease the company at an increased rent to what I was getting on my own.  

I love my home (even though I had to relocate for work) and can't stress enough the peace of mind that I have knowing that it is well-cared for.  My tenants are having a wonderful experience and that property maintenance is handled well and promptly.  The maintenance performed by their in-house contractor is top notch and very affordable.

The good: 
My espresso was very powerful & did not disappoint. 

The food was prepared to order & was delivered in a timely fashion; cooked according to my specifications. 

The crab cakes were flaky & lightly seasoned just right. 

The eggs were light, fluffy & palette-pleasing. English muffins toasted to perfection. 

Service with a smile is not on the menu, but is delivered. 

The not-so-good:
With only 8-10 parking spaces in front the door, parking is a rat race. But off-street parking & residential parking are there to save the day.

All the ingredients were fresh, but to me seemingly bland too. I think I might be the wrong kind of critic to review this place since I'm not on the band wagon for knowing good vegetarian food options. I think maybe if they would have portioned the falafel and the tzakiki sauce a little bit more evenly, it might have been better.

Service was quick and friendly. I liked that. I didn't like that it cost $7, maybe worth $5 or 6, but not $7 in my opinion.

However, the dessert we got (Fried Bananas) was wonderful. It consisted of pieces of banana inside folded wonton wrappers in a honey sauce.

Prices are very affordable--most dinner entrees were in the $6-8 range.  There's no atmosphere to speak of; it's really just one step above that of a take-out Chinese restaurant. Service was good.

Bottom line: not bad, but Saing Thai is a thousand times better.  Go there.",1
1200069,5,"Delicious pastries and the best coffee i have had so far here in Reno. I came here two days ago and i was so happy with the place i came back today. I had cappuccino and chocolate croissant, my fiancé had raspberry muffin and latte. Everything tasted fabulous. Very cute place. Right next to the river so you have a beautiful view and the bonus was man with the violin, across the street was playing it, which was perfect background of our unnecessary breakfast. Very highly recommend.",1
4324629,4,"I got a pie from Pizza D a little while ago that was just really, really salty. I mean it had pancetta on it, but still. I had picked up the pie to go and didn't eat it till I was home, so I didn't bother going back or anything.

But apparently this can happen to individual pies. I was told to call or let them know somehow if it happens. If you have a strangely bad experience, I would encourage you to speak up and see what's up.

On a more positive note, my sister and I tried the pasta for the first time last week and we are the biggest fans now. I think we may like the pasta even more than the pizza. We had the Gulf Shrimp with Red Pepper Fettuccine and the other one with Sunday Sauce(?) and they were both very good. My sister left to go back to Houston, so I got to finish all the leftovers!",1
4026619,5,"I had a wonderful time at the grand opening party for Ash & Elm Cider Co. After volunteering with Yelp for another event, I arrived at the venue in the late afternoon. As I entered Ash & Elm, I noticed that the premises was filled with smiling guests. Gazing around the room, I was impressed by the venue's decor. Exposed brick walls made the space feel modern with a vintage flair.

Approaching the bar, I was greeted with warm smiles from the bartenders and immediately given a menu. For its draught selections I tried Ash & Elm's: (1) Semi-sweet, (2) Idle Summer, and (3) Dry. Let me just say this - hard cider has never tasted so good in Indianapolis! I enjoyed everything! The ciders were so refreshing, a great contrast to the high temps outside (and warm temps inside the venue). Of the three cider selections, my favorite is the Dry. It tasted similar to champagne and who doesn't love to drink champs?

I will definitely be visiting Ash & Elm Cider Co. in the future. It seems like a wonderful place to bring your friends, make new friends, and have a great time out! My advice - Be sure to visit this venue!",1
4455324,5,By far the best Cambodian restaurant in Philadelphia. I love the steak with the pahok sauce.,1
5025736,3,Always forget to use my coupons and the staff never prompts at the register to ask if I have any which is a disappointment. I like their selection of items but their customer service is lacking. I have returns to do because some of the products I bought there in the bargain I'll have fallen apart immediately which is fine I don't expect much more from a bargain product but I realize how much money I could've saved when looking at receipts if I checker had and just asked me if I had any coupons.,1
850922,5,"Tried this place tonight after seeing the ad in Yelp hunt for a new place to try. We were pleasantly surprised!! Wait staff was attentive and helpful with selections. Food was great!!!  Got the kielbasa dip and the totters for an appetizer. I got the grouper schnitzel with cucumber salad and house pirogies, hubby got the wurst sampler. We both left overfull and happy!",1
6472765,4,Crew provides a great wash and they are efficient at getting you in and out quickly. I do think that they are a bit expensive. Mind that there is no full service optionx this is just drive thru service. There are several self service vacuum sweepers for your interior that is nice. For a quick wash its the place to go if you don't mind paying.,1
5261881,5,Food was excellent and great atmosphere so I rate a 5. Our waitress was not friendly followed by more attitude. Would go back for the shrimp and fish platter! Tartar sauce was delish!,1

1790170,4,"As a Chicagoan who regularly eats superior Italian beef sangwhiches this is my first time at an official philly cheese steak. I was pleasantly surprised how good the sand which was. The bread was good,  the meat was good. As good as an Italian beef, pretty much the same beef except without the grease and gravy. I'm not a big fan if cheese, but had to have it philly cheese wiz style with the onions and the combination was really good. The staff was very friendly. My only complaint is that their fries taste exactly like fries from Burger King.",1
6885346,5,"Admittedly, I went in here after the place of planned to pick up a few empanadas from was closed. I was looking for something good and easy to eat. I was confused about what to order so the owner suggested I get the special, he even offered me a deal and added rice, beans and plantains. I was skeptical it would be enough for two and was pricey at around $34 but OH MY, DELICIOUS!
I came home with a huge portion and carne asada, massive sweet shrimp, salads do all the fixings! It was worth every penny and I will definitely return for more!",1

959165,5,"Bodega satisfies just about every dietary phase I go through. Aside from their excellent Cuban sandwiches, they have excellent vegetarian options, including tempeh, which I don't really see often anywhere, so huuuuge shout out to them for that!

The menu is simple and small, but it covers all the important stuff. Some things I don't have experience with, so I won't comment on.

There's really nothing wrong with this place. They have a cool outdoor seating area in the back with heaters, they have tables by the street, and they also have an inside portion that is a juice shop where they make fresh juice!

They even give you your food in these sturdy paper boxes instead of wasteful Styrofoam. I would throw up some emojis right here if I could.",1
4857757,5,"Hey what is not to like!!!  
All sorts of candy abound. Most of it you buy in bulk. Anywhere from $6/lbs or $8/lbs. they also have a side fountain that serves homemade sodas and GODIVA HOT CHOCOLATE!!!!  
This place is very cool. Located in an old building. It was warm and inviting and clean!  
Try to chocolate potato chips!  Super yummy. I also really liked the sea salted caramels. I have also never seen such a collection of rock candy!  All different flavors that or course my kids dig into. 

Interestingly they have an upstairs venue that you can rent. 
They currently have comedysportz every Saturday evening at 730. Sounds like 2 teams of ""whose line is it"" that tries to garner the most LOL!  Sounds like a fantastic concept. Can't wait to check it out. 

Do yourself a favor and try this place. Very cute store across from the trailhead brewery but a short walk across the parking lot from main street.",1

2916201,3,"Sadly, I had a sub-par visit to Jazz, and have to update my review and bring it down a star. First of all, the service was poor. Lots of waiting. Took about ten minutes to get some water. The hostess actually reminded our waitress to bring us the waters and take our order. We also waited for the waitress to take our card for another ten minutes while she swept. On to the food...I got the full order of the grilled chicken pontchartrain, which was overpriced at $13.99. It came with two pieces of shrimp on top of the chicken, less than what I was expecting. There was nothing special to it, simply two thin pieces of chicken with a bland Alfredo sauce. I used Jazz's own spice mix to give it some oomph. The mashed potatoes, however, I did like. I mean, how can you not like mashed potatoes? The bf got the shrimp po boy, which I thought was pretty tasty. Also, we luckily came on a night when there was an amazing band playing upstairs (Btw, they charge 50 cents per menu item ordered to pay for the cover charge of the band. Nbd.) All in all, it was just okay. I hope others have a better experience!",1
5826344,5,"In the month we have been in Florida we have visited this restaurant at least 6x; both lunch and dinner. Monday's are especially great for 2 for 1 deals on all their beers. We've had Kayla as a waitress a couple of times now and she remembered everyone's drink in our party of 5. She's sweet, engaging and handles a full room by herself sometimes. However the food is the focus. Fresh made, great menu and awesome daily specials; plus homemade desserts. This location has tried to make it in the past with other businesses but we're hoping these winners are here to stay! See you again soon! We have another month here!",1

This is a great addition to the Carrollton/Earheart area.",1

864012,3,"Location: Convenient, right off of Rt. 70. 
Space: Very outdated, needs some fresh paint and good cleaning. 
Play-zones: I went with my 2 year old son. He enjoyed some areas very much and didn't care for others as they were geared for a little older kids. Some favorites were ambulance truck, sand art station, dinosaur room and at-the-shore. 
Price: $14 per person - I don't think it's justifiable with the state the playground was in. However, I got a Groupon $20 for admission of 4 and it was definitely worth it. Unless I get Groupon again I don't think we would come back.",1

6330319,4,"My new favorite burrito joint!

I ordered online, and when you pick it up it's waiting for you on a shelf so you don't have to interact with anyone, so I didn't get to see how the service was but that was really convenient! 

The food is REALLY delicious and seemed really fresh. I appreciate them having a fresh spring mix along side romaine so I can get in a little more nutrients. I filled my burrito bowl with things I normally get at other burrito joints, and when I did the online nutrition calculator the bowl was much lower in calories than the other places I go to! So now I don't feel as guilty getting a huge burrito bowl. I'll most likely go to this place much more than other burrito places. I'm hoping to try to queso soon. The variety of what you can get is great and I really enjoyed it.

The only reason this is not 5 stars is because the parking lot is very small and the slots are very narrow, and if you're able to find a spot to park it's a hit or miss with being able to fit your car in. I could barely open the car door to get out being next to two other compact cars, but thankfully I was just going in and out so no one could accidentally hit my door with theirs. But it's not a reason not to go! It's very yummy.",1

We had bang-bang shrimp to start - good portion size and the sauce was very tasty. Wife had shrimp and scallop fra diablo ,with homemade linguini. Zesty, spicy sauce and pasta was wonderful. I had broiled flounder, shrimp and scallops. Cooked well and tasted fresh. Our server (Gemma) was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. 

Also had some incredible-looking pizza and dessert offerings. We'll be back to give those a try next time!",1

The entertainment was great, they had everyone up dancing and singing along.  The nice surprise was the free buffet they had going on later in the evening.  We ate dinner before going out, but it was nice to have some calamari and pizza.  The drinks were a little pricy, but it seems they are everywhere anymore.",1
1499000,5,"Clean and modern, tasty food! The service was very good. We had six people and a reservation and they seated us immediately even though the place was packed. When you sit they bring out mustard and sweet and sour sauce and the chips to dip and some pickled radish/cucumber/carrot relish. I had the family dinner the wonton soup which was cabbage 3 wontons and a piece of pork in a tasty broth, an egg roll, a crab puff which was mostly cream cheese, pork fried rice, and shrimp with snow peas. That is a whole lot of food for $9.95! The veggies were not overdone and the flavors nice. I also tried the Dragon and Phoenix (not an option with family dinner) which had a little spice and their ""special sauce"" which was really good. The portions were really big...we had probably half of our food left and the waitress boxed it up nicely for us. It was a great experience overall and definitely  a place we would go back to!",1
5217776,4,"I'm one of the pickiest eaters I know. Not only because I'm choosy about the sort of food I consume, but because I'm a fanatic about how it's raised, grown, or produced. I grow most of my vegetables, raise my own chickens, and brew/ferment my own kombucha and kefir. So when I choose to eat out I'm careful about where an establishment attains their ingredients. 

Graze boasts that they use only locally raised, grass fed beef from cows that have been humanely cared for. When I eat a hamburger (which isn't often) I look for things like this. I also look for the words, ""organic"" and ""GMO-free"". I told you, I'm picky.

The burger I ordered at Graze was simply wonderful! A tiny bit too greasy for this seldom meat eater (hence the 4 star rating). It was juicy, the toppings I chose were fresh, the hand cut fries were perfectly crispy, and the curry ketchup was perfect, and I love me some curry ketchup!

AND they had blueberry soda made with cane sugar and not high fructose corn syrup! BLUEBERRY SODA!!! Yeah...I died and went to junk food heaven! but it was 'healthier' junk food heaven. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!

Would I go there again? 

You betcha!!

Often?

No...only because I really do only consume meat in very limited quantities.

Give Graze a try if you haven't already. It's in my top two burger places now. The other of which is Diablo Burger...but that's another review.",1
4087863,4,"Great casual spot for views of the bay! Chose this option over the nearby salt shack because it offers happy hour and the reviews for food were better. The happy hour menu (m-f 4-7) wasn't great at all, but I appreciated they had it. Service was pleasant and satisfactory. The smothered fish was excellent! The salmon (I ordered blackened) was perfectly cooked and delicious. Portions are also generous if you're looking for a filling meal. The Hawaiian breeze roll was awesome, especially for being wrapped in cucumber. The cucumber slices were a little thick and clumsy though. It also only came with 5 pieces which is a very small ""roll."" Great for keto eaters if you're low carb. Overall, worth going to, particularly if you like tuna. The server spoke about how exceedingly fresh it is and seafood being their overall signature!",1
5982814,5,"Simply put, I love this shack! I always make a point of visiting it during the summer often to grab some of their awesome ice cream. The service is great, and I like that you can grab a punch card so you can grab a free one on occasion as well!

There is also ample covered and uncovered outdoor space. The neighborhood is a little sketch, but whatever. The coffee is pretty good too...;). My only gripes are the parking, which is hard to locate, and the safety of the area. The food selection looks good and there are vegetarian and gluten-free options.",1
898741,5,"We've been enjoying Downey's every year when we come to SBA. This year was the best. Dan helped us select a wine, which turned out to be the very best Cabernet Sauvignons we've ever had. It was the local Foxen 7200 Cab Sauv/Vogelzang, 2010. Fabulous wine.
For dinner we shared the artichoke heart salad with a lovely light citrus dressing over greens. Our entrees were the Duck (moce and crispy skin) and the Veal Noisette, both heavenly. We did not want this meal to end, nor the bottle. We liked the wine so much we drove to Foxen (70 miles one way) the next day to buy 6 bottles.
This was a wonderfully memorable meal, one of many which keep us coming back to Downey's year after year. We missed seeing Liz (one of the owners) this year, as it was her night off.",1

The Meat used for my Gyro was already shaved and in the Hot tray resulting in warm meat on the Gyro. I was happy with the amount of meat given and the overall quality of the food.  I had the wrapped grape leaves and the loaded fries, and lastly the baklava which was incredible and with the 3.50 price. Overall one Gyro, 1 Grape leaves, 1 fries and 2 Baklava was close to 30 bucks which i thought was a bit pricey. Id try it again.",1

We each had a cocktail and I don't remember the names of any of them, but they were all delicious!! The complimentary bread rolls were SOOOOO GOOD! Warm, fluffy, delicious. We got the shrimp and grits and soft rolls for apps. Both were amazing but the shrimp and grits was a definite hit. Even people who didn't like grits liked this one!  For entrees, we got the trout, steak, and vegetable plate to share. There was a really odd long wait after we finished our apps and before our entrees came. But when the food came, it was definitely delicious!! The only thing that we didn't love was the vegetable plate. We should have asked what the veggies were before we ordered them - one of the ""veggies"" was hush puppies... overall, would definitely recommend!",1

From all the experiences I've had in the shop it seems like Troy is just as good, and just as dedicated to the craft as Vinnie . The atmosphere that these two give off makes for a barber shop that is unforgettable, I look forward to all my appointments and can't wait to be in the shop again.

The inside of the restaurant was packed and a little noisy, which was expected- it's a sports bar and grill. The weather was not too hot out, so we chose to sit outside on the patio. The patio was nice and incredibly dog friendly. There are hooks all along the railing where you can hang the leash. My husband actually left to go get our two dogs from home and brought them back. The waitress was very friendly and brought everything that we ordered out in a timely manner. She also made sure that our dogs had water and was just super nice! We first ordered a Bloody Mary and a beer, and I was very pleased with the Bloody Mary. It had some kick to it, which I like! The food was also delicious! I ordered the crab cakes and hubby ordered shrimp tacos. We split a dozen oysters. It's hard to find good seafood out in the desert (I know, I grew up on an island), and this place nailed it! The only complaint, if you want to call it that, is the oysters we're not very big, but they still tasted great! I think we have found our new local restaurant and will definitely be coming back!",1

The venue is small but quaint and they have a huge menu with lots of savory and sweet options, including options on the ""lighter side"" for those who might be on a diet or watching their caloric intake. All of their food is made with real, fresh ingredients and there are lots of options for those who are health-conscious and want to enjoy a meal out but not indulge and ""cheat.""

The reason I gave 4 stars is because the service during my second visit wasn't the best it could have been. It took them a long time to come and take our food orders for one. But also, I ordered a house brewed coffee and it never came to the table even though my friend, who ordered a cappuccino at the same time, got her beverage. I had to ask a server to bring me coffee.

You have to walk into a bar that has no Killer Poboy sign and walk to the end of the bar into a little room where you can order your Poboy. They have about 5 items on their menu. We ordered the pork belly poboy and the shrimp poboy. The pork belly poboy was on point and everyone loved it. We didn't love the shrimp poboy and felt the carrots added were also a miss.,1

The young man who took me around the car also showed me the basic items in the car to operate it - lights, wipers, etc. I want to say - all in all - one of the best experiences with a rental car agency in a long time.

1018366,4,"I don't believe that I've never reviewed AJIA.

OKAY THE FIRST TIME I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A 3 AND SAID THE WAITRESS WAS LAME, THE MUSIC WAS HILARIOUSLY BAD, AND THE ALL YOU CAN EAT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO AFFORD.

The second time I would have given 3 stars and said that each time I've been here, there's been a sweet and incredibly charming young waitress who is really quite delightful, fyi. But it's still hard for me to get my money's worth, though nice to share the all you can eat with a friend, so you can teamwork into finishing.

OKAY, FLASH FORWARD TO THE PRESENT. IT'S 2010, AND I'M GIVING THEM 4 STARS.
The young waitress has been here all three times, and this time, I paid close attention to the staff after giving my boyfriend the heads up that the one waitress is infamous. But she seems to have been distributed less interactive tasks, like seating and delivering some dishes, while the friendlier waitress takes orders, etc. I strongly believe the era of the bad waitress has ended, because even on a PACKED friday night, she didn't act rushed, and I caught her laughing with the other staff numerous times, as opposed to scowling and ignoring customers.

It says the all you can eat will charge you for condiments requested, but don't worry; soy sauce, low sodium soy sauce, wasabi, and ginger come in abundance, free of charge. Also, there is unlimited miso soup or salad.

They didn't charge me for not finishing two pieces, but I was really afraid they would, so when I had 8 pieces left, I scarfed down 6. This later lead to sickness, but don't worry, all I lost was my green tea.

THE GREEN TEA- 1.00, a little eggy, but authentically amazing.
THE GYOZA SOUP- A delicious dumpling soup that is a value over the equally priced dumplings themselves, with fantastic broth.

I was a little irritated with my orders in all-you-can eat, because, though it's hard to know what everything is, I purposely order different sushis every plate... but at least 4 pieces were exact repeats, as if they ran out/ didn't want to make what I ordered and figured I wouldn't know the difference. Frustrating, because there was a tuna that I really couldn't handle. The crunchy rolls are intensely crunchy, and there's too much cucumber in the california roll, making it a little bland.

STILL, I see great hope for AJIA. While I stuffed 28 pieces in me, I could have been done at 18... and 18 pieces come with the 9 dollar lunch special. I have decided to retire from my attempts at all-you-can-eat 24 dollar sushi, and will find piece-full sushi dining with the affordable lunch special. A new door has opened... let's hope the nice young waitress works the lunch shift, too.

Oh right, and they're BYOB.

I don't recommend large groups, because they can only take so many orders at one time, and large groups slow down service for the entire restaurant, not to mention your own table. And sometimes, the rest of us find your overwhelming presence obnoxious.",1
2635141,4,"This place is hopping game days. There literally was not a seat in the house open. Luckily we secured a couch and were able to have drinks and dinner there.
Located on second Street across from the ballpark, this little restaurant can pack them in.
Occupying the building that used to be slice,Mellow Fellow serves pub style food.
I ordered the Wit beer, it is a light beer with alot of flavor.
Mellow Fellow has all kind of activities during the week,from aycd day to do trivia.
Every once and awhile they will have a brewery come and pour there beers.
The entree I ordered was the sausage in a pretzel bun.
The sausage was linguistics, a bit spicy but very fresh. Village meats provides there sausages.
The only reason I did not give five stars, no waitress service. You have to go to the bar and order both food and drinks.
Most definitely will be back.",1

They were really busy but the Service was good!!",1
1077410,5,"TLDR: fried chicken benedict is WINNING.  Overall, great place. Would come back.

Coffee: 4 stars. I don't expect much from coffee at diners, but there's is good!

Corn Bread: 4.5 stars.  Could have been a BIT more moist, but still excellent.

Blueberry pancakes: 2.5 stars.  The low point of the meal. A fair amount of blueberries, but their pancake batter needs a lot of help.  Pancakes were uninspiring, kind of rubbery.  Not light, fluffy, moist, etc (pick your favorite pancake adjective).  I would definitely come back, I would just skip the pancakes.

Jambalaya and eggs: 5 stars. I'm not an expert on Cajun food, let alone Jambalaya, but I really enjoyed this.  The shrimp was of excellent quality, very fresh. The dish overall has a great savory flavor with just-the-right amount of spice.

Fried chicken Benedict: 5 stars. WOW.  Really tasty, perfectly fried chicken with sausage gravy, poached egg, and bacon on a fluffy hearty biscuit.

Very good service.  Good atmosphere.  Get here early on weekends.. we arrived and were seated immediately around 8:40 am.  30 minutes later there was a line out the door.",1

I have been going to The Good Egg for years.  The menu was a bit complex, but the food was good, properly proportioned and a solid value.  The servers--WITHOUT EXCEPTION--were attentive, friendly and fast.  I had my usual orders with some of the delicious flavored iced teas.  I never left hungry or disappointed.

Then the owners pumped a bunch of money into a new interior, new menu and a new name: The First Watch.  I have no idea what the new name means, given that the decor is some fusion of urban/farm stuff.  Needless to say, I was skeptical.

My concerns were quickly allayed.

The menu is simpler with fresher ingredients.  The food is AWESOME.  My new favorites are the quinoa power bowl (with an extra egg) and the chorizo/avocado omelet with artisan toast.  The fresh preserves are a bonus.

The servers remain excellent.  That has not changed.

If you want a great breakfast or a healthy lunch, you'd best be steppin' to The First Watch.  You will not be disappointed.",1

When we sat down, the first thing I noticed was the beer menu. Our waitress was was able to help both of us choose a drink that suited our taste. She even brought my boyfriend a taste of something before he committed to ordering it. 

We ordered the crab cakes and a special of the day--flat iron pork with Chipotle mashed potatoes, asparagus and charred tomatoes. The pork was cooked perfectly with a bourbon and brown sugar cream sauce that complemented it perfectly. The chipolte mashed potatoes were quite possibly the best part of the meal--I would go back just for them. My boyfriend enjoyed his crab cakes, and the rice they were served with was delicious. The service wasn't the best I've had, our waitress seemed distracted, but it was far from the worst we've had. 

All in all, we had a great meal, and we plan to go back soon!",1

6285696,5,"This is my all-time favorite vintage clothing store in Tampa--and it might very well be one of the only that I know of. It's even worth the precarious backing-out-into-high speed-traffic parking situation going on with this plaza.

I hate giving up a good find so others will get dibs on things I'd want to buy, but you gotta give credit where credit is due. Great selection of vintage as well as new-but-vintage-inspired clothes packed in a little store. I even went so far as to have the woman working here strip the poor wo-mannequin of her outfit because it was the most amazing little super lowcut back dress I've ever seen. Less than $30, you bet it's mine. I also scored a really great light blue long sleeve dress on their sale rack for under $10. I also saw some shoes and accessories lounging around.

This review reminds me I haven't been in a while, so you'll probably see me in there again soon.",1

She cut my hair, so that my natural flip and wave would air dry beautifully...without a ton of product. I was amazed at what a little bit of diffusing and some salt spray did for my hair!

He was so easy to work with and getting scheduled was a breeze.  The most important thing in my book? He was honest - one of our carpets was just not going to be able to be saved - he told us this upfront because he did not want to charge us for a job that wouldn't work - he enabled us to make a decision as the homeowners and really seemed to value our hard earned money.  I will definitely keep referring him and use him again down the road because of this honesty - it's just too hard to come by these days.",1

My meal at Square Root was, truly, the most delicious thing I've eaten in my life and anyone who knows me is probably tired of me referencing it.  

The fried chicken cotton candy with a fried okra that started the tasting was absolutely outstanding but nothing will ever top the short rib with bone marrow sauce that ended up labeled ""Short Rib Heaven"" in my tasting notes from the evening. 

From start to finish, the service was absolutely impeccable. Chef Lopez hand delivering each course and describing them was a lovely touch for the evening and made it that much better. 

We opted for the nicer of the wine tasting menus to pair and I am quite certain there were wines that I will never have the pleasure of tasting again -- each of them paired perfectly and were so delicious.

By the end of the meal, we were full and in awe.  And we knew that every meal would never be the same.

I highly recommend visiting if you get the chance.",1

It's supposed to seat over a 1,000 people so they need parking and they sure do have it. You should never have trouble finding a spot. We made a reservation so we were seated as soon as we walked in. I was not pleased with the table location. It was way in the back and in a corner with a kitchen door that was right next to the table. The service was pretty slow as well. Finally a server came over to take our drink order.  We ordered the white sangria. Mixed at table side it was delicious. Also, some Barcelona beer. The server started us out with some warm Cuban bread and butter. It was very good. I ordered the Shrimp Supreme. Heavily breaded med. shrimp with a small bed of rice on the side. It was just OK. Also ordered a small 1905 salad. Mixed at table side it was very good. My wife ordered the Friday Special, a Mahi-mahi sandwich. Overall the food was good but, the service was very slow.

Such a great experience to do something so peaceful surrounded by amazing works of art! Definitely different but worth the experience! The art museum in Philly is so priceless and a must see if you are anywhere in the area. So fun to see everyone try to run the steps like Rocky and take a pic with the statue itself! We were there and a bride ran it in her dress!!!

***Quick Tip*** If you want to do the steps at all go around sunset it's going to give you such beautiful views of the city and great pictures!! Around the holidays they have the tree lit up and it's so beautiful! They have a parking garage around the back you can park at which is the easiest or always take an über and have them drop you off right in front! Coat check is also inside for convenience. This place houses beautiful works of art and is worth the trip. 

We cannot wait to go back!!! Always check out the website for different exhibits they have all year round....",1

The price was reasonable.  My room was very modern -- and nicely appointed -- and it was stocked full of amenities (a microwave, mini-fridge, Keurig coffee maker, etc).  I recommend this inn.

3461860,5,"Now, if you're going to have Italian in Nashville, I can only speak for this place. Having sampled many other cuisines in town, this was a first.

First things first... MAKE A RESERVATION, especially if you're going on a Friday or Saturday night. We didn't know what time we were getting there, so we couldn't really. The wait was an hour, the bar was even full...but the wait is fine, if you have great company and love to people watch. Also the restaurant itself is a beautiful, old school-but-elegant, place. The only downfall I will caution you is... Don't indulge in alcohol too much... As the restrooms are down a rather long and steep staircase..and there were an awful lot of ladies in heels (not me) that might have an issue with that. 

Once we got seated, our waiter brandished his smooth-but-cheesy tourist-friendly banter with aplomb and soon enough, our teas and bread arrived too tide us over.

A fan of eggplant, I nevertheless vacillated between that and the linguini with clams from my childhood, but the eggplant won out. My famished date ordered the chicken marsala, though he was sorely tempted with a flashback to his previous visit's sketti and meatballs.

A short while later, four perfect medallions of eggplant arrived, with sketti. The purple veg was perfectly cooked and the sauce was balanced and flavorful. Sampling the marsala also proved just as satisfying. 

All in all, great place, worth the wait and within a short walk to the Acropolis, which is incredibly lovely at night and a great way to walk off that pasta. Mangia!",1

2990978,5,"I'm just leaving KiKu right now, it was the first time I've ever been there. I had some time to kill and was hungry. Just about every other sushi place was closed so I decided to try this place out. One of the best culinary decisions of my life.

I ordered a yellowtail sashimi to start with, as well as a spider roll. The sashimi was served as 2 HUGE extremely fresh pieces, and the spider roll was absolutely amazing. I order spider rolls basically everywhere I go, and this was by far the best I've ever eaten.

While I was eating those, everything was so good I decided to order a yellowtail roll. There was a tiny bit of rice and giant pieces of fish inside. It was to die for.

I also sampled a sweet and sour cucumber and seaweed appetizer compliments of the sushi chef, which was also delicious. 

Overall, I could not be happier. I read a few reviews of this place that weren't so good, so I was leary of trying it, but those were from several months ago. After trying it for myself I can confidently say this is the best sushi I've ever had in my life, and I've been to quite a few restaurants.

If I could rate KiKu higher than 5 stars I would. I was absolutely blown away by the service and the quality. Even down to the pickled ginger which actually wasn't pink like almost everywhere you go.

If you're a sushi fanatic like me, this place is an absolute must try. Prices are in par with everywhere else you're going to go to, if not lower, and the quantity and quality of food you're going to be served is unmatched.",1
6377821,4,"Grilled sliced pork on rice is great! The pork is amazing and delicious (or maybe that's bc i was STARVING). This place is kinda expensive for an Asian place though. Lots of Chinese places have bigger portions for cheaper prices, so I wouldn't come here too often. Actually, this is my first time here and probably my last too lol. While I do like the pork here, i can easily find equally good pork in cheap places in chinatown.",1

A couple of dishes had to be sent back because they were not hot and then there didn't seem to be a sense of urgency to get those plates back out again.  Glad I went to see what all the fuss was about, but would not go back.",1
3537173,3,"Pros: great location near Creve Coeur lake! There aren't really any restaurants nearby, so having this literally minutes away is a huge pro. The outside eating area was also really spacious, and it would have a pretty view of the water if the water didn't look as gross. 

Cons: Can't move the outside tables to accommodate larger parties. But that's totally understandable! They were also out of a certain beer, which at first seemed odd for 11:30 am. But it might just be indicative of how great the business was the night before. 

The food: most people in my group ordered a sandwich - club, blt, portobello burger, etc. I ordered the club on wheat berry bread. It was a solid sandwich, and The bread was really good. Most people enjoyed their food, but it wasn't like the best thing anyone ever ate. My table ordered pretzel bites to start, and they were nice and salty. Id say they were your average baked pretzel nuggets. No one tried the cheese sauce they came with, so I can't speak to that. The service was pretty quick, unlike what other Yelp reviewers experienced. The bathrooms were also clean.",1

And I have to say, it exceeded my expectations! I posted photos of our visit on other social media and had a slew of folks messaging me asking, ""WHERE IS THIS?"" because it was that impressive.

The trees covered tip to trunk in lights, the timed displays with music, the incredibly artistic and inventive home decor in the Lilly House, the spiked hot cocoa and beverages, and the fun little glasses that turn each light bulb into a snowflake made the experience truly magical. 

Worth a visit, no contest. Whether you like Christmas or not the lights are incredible and worth a visit. Just buy your tickets ahead of time, it will sell out.",1
3185354,4,"My friends and I came here for brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon. We made a reservation ahead of time and unfortunately our original table was taking too long to leave so they had to prepare a new table for us but the wait wasn't too bad. 

Food: We were a group of 6 and everyone enjoyed their food. They were out of a few items which made me change my order, but I'll just have to come back and try what I originally wanted. My girlfriend ordered a side of grits wit her burger and she said that they were very good. The fries that came with my BLT were really good. Others in our group had pancakes, French toast, sausage, western omelette, potatoes, and more and everything was delicious 

Drinks: Although we didn't take advantage of it, I really like that this place lets you BYOB and doesn't charge you the opening fee. I also like that they have a brunch happy hour. I ordered a white sangria which was good but could use a little more sweetness from fruit in it.

Would definitely recommend placing a reservation if you plan to come in as it was very packed today. You can always sit at the bar and enjoy a drink while you wait too.",1

And they've done it in a relatively short time, just a few years. Giusti's is centuries old and Balducci at least 100 years.  Usually stores like these need the patina of age to make them appealing.

963715,5,"EVOS serves up ""fast food"" with passion and a health conscious edge. I enjoy that there are a variety of healthy salads, sandwiches, smoothies (organic), kids meals, organic low-fat milkshakes and soup.

This was the first EVOS in the chain and I believe that the owners have stayed steadfast to their vision to have healthy, quality food which has not been compromised by their expansion. The restaurant is clean and bright and the workers are very friendly and helpful. I enjoy that the burgers are composed of hormone and antibiotic free meat, and that they use lean meats, such as the all-white meat turkey patty. 

The salads are made with organic greens which I appreciate. The vegan burger is delicious and I enjoy the chili. Also, the cookies are 70% organic and they offer a chocolate chip and an oatmeal cranberry orange which are very good. 

Their air fries are the bomb.com and they now offer sweet potato airfries in addition to regular ones. I appreciate that they aren't friends and are lower in fat and to me just as tasty as fries (the whole ""fried thing"" takes away from the enjoyment of how good the food really tastes because I know it's fat-laden. There are 4 different ketchups available for you to try.

I like that the meals are made to order and therefore somewhat customizable by way of modifications, etc. changing something on my wrap order has never been an issue and I appreciate that. 

There is patio seating out front for you to enjoy the lovely Tampa weather and many tables inside for single or group seating. There also is hand sanitizer on the wall and a well organized beverage and condiment area. There are also magazines available in a rack by the checkout to browse through during your short wait.

I was already thinking about ordering it and heard the woman sitting in back of us exclaim ""it was the best raviolis ever"" so I knew it was a solid choice.My mom had chicken tortieinni panna prosciutto chicken pistelle,husband had spaghetti carbonara and my dad had the linguine seafood. We all had a side garden salad.Everyone enjoyed their dishes! My husband thought the spaghetti carbonara was good not really a stand out from other Italian restaurants though.Next time he'll have the meat raviolis.
The only tiny complaint from my mom was her dish had no chicken at all and I hardly had any mushrooms in my ravioli dish(unlike the pic in advertisements).
We all will definitely come back! Fantastic service and our waiter and other wait staff made us feel pampered. We really appreciated the tiramisu dessert for my parents 32 year anniversary. My husband and I shared the chocolate cherry filled cheesecake .",1

6030082,4,"I ordered in from NJP after reading good reviews here.  I got a Romano and a Home Style pizza. 

The Romano was pretty good - I was a little disappointed about the lack on basil on it though.  It's listed as an ingredient on the menu, but the pizza just had a sprinkling of dried basil flakes.  I had expected lots of fresh basil from the description.  But aside from that, it was still quite tasty.  

The Home Style.... so good!  I LOVED it - a thick layer of cheese and delicious sauce.  What's not to like??  I'm glad I ordered a large - I can't wait to eat more of it for breakfast tomorrow!",1

Being a bit hard of hearing, I find it difficult to hear what my companions are saying, but we know it isn't going to be a place to find a quiet dinner -- and we still return for the setting and the great memories of previous visits.  Lip reading and leaning in does the trick, at least most of the time.",1

6768988,4,This place is BUSY for brunch time so reservations is a must. We made reservations while walking and our table was ready by the time we got there. The chicken St.Charles was decent. Fried chicken was good. Eggs were good. I just think the biscuit could have a little more flavor. The portion size is very good. I couldn't finish my food and the pricing is reasonable. I wanted a hot black tea but they didn't have any hot tea available which was a little weird but that's okay. Worth trying!,1
4622977,3,"*Went to this restaurant on a Saturday Night.
*This restaurant serves Indian Thali (which is UNLIMITED)
*Thali had the following contents:
3 curries, dal, rice, desert, raita and chapati

* The food can be termed as ""Above Average"" for it's taste and quality

* We also ordered Indian Lassi as a side order which was not the original Lassi as it is made everywhere else such that this one was water based (very thin) instead of it being known for it's thick posture made out of milk.

Pros:
* Above average food quality and taste
* Very good interiors
* Good management

Cons:
* Parking can be difficult on busy nights",1
4504298,5,"This review is based on their beignets and coffee. The famous Cafe du Monde's beignets had left me with disappointment. So I decided to tryout Cafe Beignet after walking past  it two days in the row. To my great delight - the beignets here are WAY better than Cafe du Monde's. They were soft and fluffy, perfectly fried to order ""dream pillows."" Each order of 3 beignets is a dollar more than Cafe du Monde but it's so worth it. Cafe au lait was good too. It's quiet in the afternoon but there's a steady stream of customers coming through. A musical duo was playing jazz, nice deco, cool ambiance, and great place for people watching. This is definitely the place to get my brignet fix!",1

Service: 5 Stars (excellent service. Very nice staff)

Value: 3 stars (a meal for two and spring rolls came out to around $50. It was tasty but neither of us were full.)

All in all, not a bad place to try. I'd suggest Bangkok Thai restaurant on Ohio. That one still ranks as my top choice in Indy.",1
3974842,4,"They have a pretty extensive happy hour menu so we decided to give this place a try. Happy hour is from 3-6pm and they gave us a heads up when we entered that it was going to be cash only. Our personal favorites were the crispy shrimp golden pouches and fried calamari. Shrimp golden pouches were filled with meaty crisp shrimp and were deep fried to perfection. The sweet and sour sauce on the bottom had good flavor. The calamari came in small strips and were well seasoned. The weakest item we tried was definitely the banh mi. It was very dry. It needed mayo or some kind of sauce. All the other items (mini chicken fried rice, beef skewers, fishball skewers) were decent. 

Service was good. Our server was nice enough to come around and ask us for a last call for happy hour. She also made sure to check in with us from time to time. Being that this is one of the only sports bar in Chinatown, we will be back for happy hour or during a game. They have a good amount of TVs around the bar after all.",1

391000,4,"First of all, this place is visual stunner!  As you enter, you can see the seating on both floors, the bar that runs from nearly front to back, and the kitchen where your food is being freshly made.  It was kind of busy, being Sunday afternoon, so our group of 5 sat at the large 'family-style' table running down the restaurant.  

They had a ton of boozy-milkshakes available, but as soon as I saw that espresso machine, I knew I wanted (read: needed) an americano (the bar-crawl the night before did me in!).  

I decided that it was the day that I try bison considering the place is known for their killer burgers.  I got the PB&J - which had arugula pesto, bison patty, house 
tomato jam, goat cheese, and fresh arugula.  It was good.  Good.  I say that because the goat cheese and tomato jam were banging, but I wasn't crazy about the bison burger itself (my fault, granted) but also the bun was dry?  But not because it was stale, I'm pretty sure they are just made that way.  Next time, I'll try the pretzel bun and hope it'll be chewier.  That being said, the fries were killer!  I picked the chipotle ketchup, which I'm pretty sure is made in house too.  

Overall, great stuff going on here.  My choice was a little off, but at no fault of Range's itself.  I'm excited to try more burgers here!",1

640915,3,"I found this place based on yelp reviews, and I really hate to ruin the 5 Stars. But this is my honest review . Located on a busy street it's a bit tricky to find. Parking is limited but I believe there are two spots in the back. You cannot park in any of the spots in the front as the clinic owns that I was told. 

being in my third trimester with the third prenatal massage (different establishments) I would say this is a more relaxing experience. 
Meaning lots of methodical hand movements, very soft and very gentle. Want to make you fall asleep type of massage. However , Specifically what I was not asking for. At this point in my pregnancy I was having some lower back pain and right arm pain. Most of the therapist that I go to are able to find the triggerpoints and help relieve the symptoms: when I asked her to not be afraid to go deeper her methods remained the same. Needless to say half of the massage I did not feel anything. It was like having my husband put lotion on for me. I think for a $75 prenatal massage plus tip ,  I would like to leave feeling relieved rejuvenated and that it helped with something. Maybe it's me being picky but I am used to deep tissue, pinpoint the problem area massages. So maybe I got the wrong idea from these reviews but yes come here if you want a nice gentle relaxing massage. 
Also having been a hairstylist in my prior career for seven years and getting massages every two weeks, I would suggest that the owners provide or offer a warm towel after the massage. It is customary to wipe off the excess oil so that it does not get all over your car and you end up slip and sliding in your sandals. I would also recommend you offer clients a cup of small water after the massage or at least let clients know that they need to drink lots of water to flush out the toxins from a 60 minute massage. That is also customary . Before I was informed of the importance of hydration after massage and perhaps was 'catching a cold' , it would make my symptoms worse as strange as that sounds. But hey everybody's different I may have a weeker immune system.",1

Though we did get to try a few samplers, talk with the owners, and get a feel for the pub at the elite event, I really didn't feel it was fair to do a full on review.  So now that I was back I figured I'd give it a go.

I wish this place was closer to my house! The food was top notch and the service was fantastic.  Even on a busy Sunday afternoon with the Pub full we felt like all of our needs were attended to and our server was never far away!  I had the brie cheese (topped with pecans and cranberries with a peppery crusty bread) and the Tomato Soup entree. Both were delicious and I'd order again!

My group also ordered sliders, pulled pork burgers, french fries and a few other items and no one had complaints.  I'd highly recommend coming for a casual dinner out.  What was really cool too was that we had reserved a spot over to the side, with couches and tables and our own separate TV and fireplace.  It felt super cozy and a great way to watch a sports event with your friends.  They also had a massive screen in the main part of the pub with tables set up to watch too so really you can't lose!  I'll definitely be back when I'm down on the south side!",1

First, the ice cream is generously portioned... 3 big scoops and very cheap.

The nutella & banana crepe was tasty. A standard dessert done well.

The poached apple crepe was good, but would try something different next time. I guess I had imagined it would be more like apple pie filling (soft with cinnamon sugar) than harder pieces of apple. Good thing though it wasn't too sweet.

I really liked the crepes themselves, hard to describe the layers and consistency, just know they're tasty!

The cafe has many interesting desserts, cheat days beware!! :)",1

We were treated like celebrities. Lenny recommended specials based on what we had on our first visit. Although I can't remember the names of the dishes, mine was a Tilapia dish and Steve had a beef medallion dish. Both dishes were great. The Tilapia had Scallops, Asparagus, mashed potatoes and a red wine sauce. The beef medallions came in a Marsala sauce 

We also had toasted bread with pesto and a tomato sauce on the side. This took Steve back to his Italian roots :) ""Exactly how grandma use to make it"". 

We also tried the sauteed calamari with spinach and nuts. 

We had the same dessert as last time but this time our chef was kind enough to make it without the orange and raspberry layers. It was so good we had almost finished it by the time Lenny came to ask us how it was. lol.

The barkeep stepped up and introduced us to a couple of the Philly Blues fans and we enjoyed our afternoon visiting and having a couple of pints. The pub is larger than at first gander and boasts a decent menu.  We ordered some quesadillas I believe which were fine, it was just something to munch on.  There were some very good looking food going out to tables.  They pour a good pint of black and I enjoyed a small whisky and a Harp.  Game went well, company was good.

440878,4,"Elevated Pub Food with great beers and cocktails is what you will find here at the Pub & Kitchen.  This place has been added to my regular rotation of great bars in the city that also serve great food.  The Churchill Burger is a must order, as it is one of the best in the city.  Is it my favorite burger of all time?  Maybe not, but it is damn tasty.  So simple, the special blend of LaFrieda meat really is the star with this burger.  Topped simply with caramelized onions and Bone Marrow butter, it is super tasty.  The fries were awesome as well, extra crispy and plentiful. Some of the best fries in the city.

The menu is rather small with daily specials, but I appreciate that, as every item is done really well.  The bar definitely has that New York atmosphere as I am sure that is what they are going for. Especially with serving NY's LaFrieda beef along with a variety of offerings from NY's SixPoint Brewery.  Mmmmmh Bengali Tiger - one of my favorite beers.  It is rather dark inside as others have complained about, but I don't really mind it.  Expect to see patrons using their cell phone's LED to read the menu.  The female bartenders are great.  Attractive and knowledgeable. What more can you ask for?  Yes, another beer.",1

The abundance of low-quality merchandise, uninformed employees, not to mention Walmart's often manipulative stranglehold over their vendors, causes me to, apparently, only shop here during a pandemic... Both customers and workers were ignoring any sort of social distancing and I don't recall seeing any employee wearing a mask. (This contrasts vividly with the situation I encountered at Whole Foods earlier in the day.) But they had toilet paper available here when no other place I visited had.

As someone else mentioned, the flavors are a little different from a typical Indian restaurant but by no means bad. The decor is nice and the employees friendly. 

Now the reason for 3 stars.  They are a little expensive for the size of the portions as I have been to places in Tucson that give you twice the amount of food for roughly the same price. The dishes are a little light on meat, again for the price paid. It would also be nice if they threw in the naan with each order. Let's be honest, paying extra for naan is like going to a Mexican restaurant and them charging you for chips and salsa. 

That being said, it is nice to have this option in Sahuarita.",1
1639334,4,"TL;DR - Solid and consistent, if unspectacular Mexican food

My go-to is the ""naked burrito"". I vary up the meats, usually adding black beans, cheese, pico de gallo and guacamole. All of the ingredients are pretty standard, but I really appreciate not paying extra for the guac. 

Service is so-so, but the line is usually short. Even though there's better food at the Terminal, I often find myself getting lunch here during work because it's quick, reliable, affordable and I can at least pretend I'm eating healthy. Closer to 3.5 stars if I could.",1

I tried my wife's mild and it was great without the heat. I found out the sauce is made with ghost peppers the hottest pepper in the world. I only recommend this sauce to people who like it really hot. I had the Mac and cheese and it was very tasty and I recommend,

4740025,4,"After spending the entire week battling a serious sushi craving, I could not ignore it any longer. Around 4:30 PM on a Saturday, I finally caved in and went on a hunt for the best ""new to me"" sushi place I could find. Many thai restaurants are closed at this time of day for their mid afternoon break, but lucky for me Amarit had just reopened at exactly 4:30, so I met up with a friend and we headed in for what was sure to be a fabulous sushi adventure.

Upon entering, we were seated right away. The environment here is decorated in very ornate and traditional thai decor and it is a bit dark in here, however it creates a relaxing and peaceful ambience. The server came over to greet us and he dropped the sushi menu on our table --- the menu of heavenly, heavenly goodness. 

We were in a bit of a rush to order, so I picked the Mexican roll and my friend chose the JB (or was it ""JD""?) Tempura Roll. They were prepared quickly and we couldn't wait even 1 minute to dive in. We both tried our own and then swapped and tried the others. Both were fantastic. The mexican roll was fresh and light with great flavor. The JB was fried, with a sweet sauce on top and was tasty down to the last piece of rice left on the plate. Believe me, there were NO leftovers.

Overall we had a great experience here. The prices were on par, service was quick and friendly and they also have a full menu of thai entrees which I plan to return and try soon.",1
5337383,5,"Again, LOVE this place. BYOB, huge portions of delicious Mexican food. Creamy guacamole to start with the chips, highly recommend.

Now I usually get the #29 dinner combo, I'd say 99.8% of the time. It's $13 for a ton of food. 

Tonight I was really feeling a Chile rellano so i got the #31 combo: beef burrito, chicken enchilada, Chile rellano, rice, and beans...I added a taco because their tacos are awesome... And the 29 has tacos instead of the rellano, rice, and beans. So I got the best of both worlds. Seriously, this is my new order from now on. Obesity at it's finest! Ha-ha

Pecan pie was great, buttermilk pie was great. Now the Banana pudding was Excellent! The staff was fantastic and friendly. However the staff serving the food could use an attitude adjustment. Overall I would recommend this place for lunch",1

We shared the calamari, brussel sprouts and baked potato. My husband ordered the ribeye and I had the filet, both were delicious! We got a free desert since it was our anniversary and we chose the creme brûlée and it was PHENOMENAL! If you're a fan of creme brûlée, I highly recommend ordering it.",1
6576169,5,"Went to both locations and this one is safer and has a wider variety of sandwiches.  These sandwiches are so large and fed three of us.  We were leaving for the airport so we couldn't our favorite the Paesano and got the smoke turkey instead.  It was good with the Arugula but if we could eat right there, the hot sandwiches are better.  Must visit when in Philly!",1

I dropped my car off the other day for the regular lube/oil/filter/tire rotation  and for a software recall and dropped it off earlier than my appointment and they were able to take care of my vehicle immediately, I planned on being car-less for the rest of my afternoon but thanks to Mazdas service I didn't have to be! When I got my vehicle back they even left a cold water bottle and a car shaped sugar cookie inside- which I thought was a really nice touch. Great experience and everyone was super helpful, knowledgable and friendly. Definitely recommend taking your vehicle here!",1

2406964,4,"Was here with a group of 10 guys for a bachelor party.  The NY strip I ordered was likely the best steak I've ever had. Charred perfectly on the outside and with great texture and flavor. Between the ten of us, we must have ordered every variation of meat on the menu except for the porterhouse. One person ordered the $100 cheese-steak and said it was good, but not great (the half bottle of champagne is a big portion of the cost). Some folks had the caviar and said it was fantastic (and these were people who don't normally eat caviar). I had the lobster bisque to start and it was a perfect texture, but perhaps a little on the salty side (more on that later).  I wish I hadn't ordered the soup because the NY strip was so fantastic and I couldn't finish the entire 24 oz which felt like an immense waste of great meat.

I'd give the place five stars if it weren't for the fact that all the sides we had (creamed spinach, truffle potatoes, broccoli rabe) were over-salted. Cocktails were pretty good and service was unobtrusive and professional. The wine list is a typical steakhouse tome, lots of Bordeaux and big California reds. Markups on wine are a bit higher than I would have expected, but someone's got to pay for the fabulous space I guess. I was pleasantly surprised by the very good (and extensive) selection of white wines.",1

They don't give you much to eat, so you are basically paying for the ambiance I would presume. I do hope some day I can afford to go before I die.  But for now I can live the experience through all of the Reviewers that take the time to post their photos along with the review.",1
2316905,4,"Really good food. The restaurant staff couldn't have been better. If I lived here this would be a regular haunt. The manager (Jess) came by the table to see how we were doing.

1563135,5,"Ate here for Devour Downtown and was more than pleasantly surprised. Not only did the service not waver once we told them we were ordering off the Devour Downtown menu - but they seemed to up it a notch. Our server wanted to make sure we had an evening to remember. He was able to answer each one of our questions with the utmost of ease whether it was about the artwork on the walls or about the food we were eating. The chef even brought out a special little appetizer for us - compliments of the chef - and it was amazing! They saw to our every need - drinks, food, bill - it was all on time and delivered with flair. The food was amazing as well - well cooked and excellently flavored. A great way to celebrate a night out on the town - you won't be disappointed.",1

Thai jerky, sauces to try, other samplings, plants,.crafts and a cheery neighborhood with passionate peeps who take pride in their community. I enjoyed my visit a lot even though I ate too much.

2467065,5,"Tampa Hybrids is a lifesaver!  I took my 2007 Prius to Tampa Hybrid after three warning lights appeared (master warning light, brake system warning light, and malfunction indicator lamp). Immediately, I could tell Todd was very knowledgeable and honest. Todd had my car up and running promptly and also replaced two HID headlights, all at a very affordable price. Thanks to him and his work, my Prius' MPG is up. He isn't your typical pushy auto repair or sale person. It's great because you know you won't get taken for all your money. Todd even contacted me after the work was done to make sure my car was running smoothly. HIGHLY recommended for anyone who owns a Prius or is in the market for one.  I know I will be back once I'm ready for another Prius.",1

967442,5,"I very rarely throw down the 5/5 but I'm going to have to for this place. 

My first rendezvous with Parc (see what I did there using French words and shit?) was soon after I moved here in early summer 2017. I was brought here for drinks during that ridiculous heat wave so we sat roasting at one of the outside tables. I went with one of the beers and had a very delightful conversation with the waiter. I had just shoveled hummus down my throat at dizengoff and any square inch of room that remained in my stomach was reserved for alcohol. 

Because I'm basic AF, I wanted to leave a review however I did not think the few beers I had would allow me to do Parc justice so I abstained. I abstained until I had the opportunity to consume something solid. LOL. Try not to make any suggestive analogies there please.

Like the n00b that I am, I tried to come back with my brunch-broad-bff on another weekend WITHOUT a reservation. What a fucking idiot. We had to wait in LINE to even put our names down for a table. I'm not one who likes to wait. 

I finally got my shit together enough to make a reservation for brunch this past weekend when I was celebrating stuff. 

I met my friends here, a few minutes late of course because of that fucking trader joe's line. Classic. I picked up that beautiful menu to survey the options. I went straight for the eggs, my brunch go-to. The menus are huge, I particularly like things when they're over-sized. Try not to make suggestive analogies there again please.

I ordered the goat cheese and spinach omelette and I also went with the Romarin cocktail (rosemary infused vodka, elderflower, grapefruit). One of my friends got the Nicoise Salad, side of fries and the Basilic cocktail (I am now officially too lazy to spell out the ingredients). Other friend ordered the quiche lorraine. I forgot to specify eggs almost on fire but I made sure to mention absolutely no onions. This will become important later on in the story.

After some bitching-about-our-lives, the food arrived. My friend's quiche was GIGANTIC! Talking about big things, jesus christ. I couldn't fucking believe how huge that shit was. I noticed almost immediately that the potatoes that came with my omelette had onions in them and made a loud remark about that that I think the waiter overheard. He came over to apologize and offer me another serving of potatoes. When I saw how fucking orgasmic my friend's fries were, I had to ask for some of those. 

Listen to me very carefully. Do not come to this restaurant without getting fries. They are absolutely incredible. They are thin and crispy. They come with a side of ketchup and mayo. They are seasoned with salt to perfection. They are absolutely spectacular and quite possibly some of the best strips of potato heaven I have ever had the privilege to pass through my digestion tract. 

My omelette was raw as fuck on the inside which normally turns me off tremendously. In this case, I didn't even care. It was so good I polished off the entire plate. 

Oh, I forgot to mention. The bread they give you on the table is also out of control. They have three types. This one heftier type with some nuts and dried fruit, whole wheat, and classic baguette. 

The service was amazing as well. Took our orders quickly, knowledgable about the menu, immediately rectified the onion issue and gave me that whole order of potatoes. After asking for hot sauce it arrived in two shakes of a lamb's tail. 

Yes it is slightly on the expensive side but who fuckign cares it's delicious and it's worth it. I can't wait to come back to this place.",1

3436273,5,"This was my first time at Nashville's Legendairy Milkshake Bar, and let me be the first to say they live up to their name. My S.O. and I came here for a date night and it did not disappoint. Tables and menus are socially distanced so you can browse and enjoy your treats without having to group up next to others. Not to mention the staff, who are all masked, bring the milkshakes directly to your table. Not having to pick up your treats at a window in which everyone's germs can mingle is amazing! We opted for their s'mores and breakfast milkshakes, and they were both delicious! If you're looking for sweet, tasty, and COVID safe place to stop Legendairy Milkshake bar is the place to go!",1

1874171,3,"Hmm..  great service but mediocre food. 

Fleming's is located on Boy Scout Rd, across from international plaza. There are no shortage of parking spaces since it's surrounded by other restaurants lol. 
Our awesome server Lori was amazing and made us feel at home. 

As far as the food goes, we ordered Bone-in ribeyes with Fleming's potatoes and Brussel sprouts. Ribeyes were good (nothing memorable) but the sides weren't appetizing at all. Potatoes were barely warm (no kidding), the steel bowl it came in was cold. Brussel Sprouts with bacon was sweet and bitter. I understand the sweet aspect but wasn't sure why it was bitter. Maybe the vinegar burned? 

Since it was a special occasion, we decided on creme brûlée for dessert. There was nothing special about it, I'd hoped they would put their own spin on a classic dessert. 

Overall, i wasn't blown away with the meal.",1

She was very attentive to my needs and paid close attention as I described my medical history and my reason for getting a massage.  She has clearly worked very hard to develop and refine her skill and technique.  For nearly an hour she focused exclusively on my lower back (at my request) and her efforts brought me some much needed relief from pain that has plagued me for quite some time.  While a single massage couldn't possibly resolve all my back issues, it was wonderful to be able to truly relax.  I also thoroughly enjoyed our conversation as we listened to and chatted about wonderful classical music and memories.  I also appreciated that she asked me what I wanted to listen to music-wise and that she had a perfect balance between engaging in conversation vs allowing only the music break the silence in the room.  10/10, 5 stars, highly recommend... it doesn't matter what scale you want to use, I would put her at the top.  Best massage therapist I have ever had.  Period.  I will be back and I will be asking for Sandy by name.",1
1737808,4,"People always expect way too much from a chain restaurant. This place has been my husband and men's go to restaurant in the area. The bread sticks are always great we get a side of alfredo sauce and the salad.  I stopped trying new things because I didn't like them. I usually stick to shrimp or chicken alfredo keeping it nice and simple. They have primo amore moscato which I can't find in stores in the area so I love that.  It's an amazing wine and I usually get a bottle when I am there plus if you don't finish it they let you take it home. I usually get a bottle to keep as a reserve at home. They just got these electronic ordering systems where we ordered our drinks, appetizers, and desserts on. We also can pay on them when using a card so it's nice to go quickly instead of having to wait.",1

315692,5,"We couldn't be happier to have a place we love for Peruvian food in Reno! I'm from Florida and am used to a greater variety of Latin American cuisines, so I was a little disappointed when I moved here a couple years ago and noticed my options were much more limited. Peruvian food is one of my favorite cuisines and Sabor does an excellent job providing great menu options and the things we tried tonight at dinner were executed wonderfully. 

Our meal started with the appetizers Papa a la Huancaina (soft potato slices covered with a yellow, cheesy sauce) and Sabor Causas (2 layers of mashed, lemony and flavorful potatoes with shrimp and avocado in the center and on top), and then we shared the Seafood Combo Entree which came with  good portions of ceviche (citrus marinated raw fish), Jalea (lightly battered and fried fish, calamari, fish, and yuca), and 4 cooked Muscles topped with corn, tomatoes and a ceviche-like sauce. Ceviche was my favorite. I think when we come next we will get the ceviche again but as a shared appetizer. Each of the other things we tried were also deliciously prepared and we will definitely be coming back soon. 

I'd also recommend going on a week day rather than a busy Saturday night at 6:30. It seems as if they didn't expect to be nearly full and there was only 1 waitress for the whole place. She did a great job but some people were visibly irritated while waiting. We didn't mind because we weren't in any hurry and our first appetizer came out 5 minutes after we ordered it so we didn't get hangry. I think it could be attributed to being relatively new and growing pains that'll be worked out. 

We had a great experience here and will definitely be back soon to try some of their other options. If you have never had Peruvian food I urge you to give this place a try! It also has options for your less-adventurous, Mexican-food loving friends and family.",1

I had the eggs, sausage and pancakes. The eggs did not taste like real eggs, and if by some chance they were real eggs the kitchen killed them. The pancakes were like cardboard with no flavor and a weird texture.  The lady that waited on us was really great and I'm sorry I don't remember her name. Another thing that was great was the coffee. They have fabulous coffee!  Overall I was not impressed but maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, and next time will be better. I'll have to give it another try and maybe just order something different to eat, but I definitely want more of their coffee.",1

When we first entered, I noticed the very traditional Thai setting. It had a very classy and fine dining atmosphere. The table setting was really fancy, yet it was a smaller restaurant. I really enjoyed the quiet and classy traditional environment.

 We did family style and shared the fried calamari, creamy Tom yum noodles soup and the Thai basil beef. They were all excellent! The sauce for the fried calamari was really different, but complimented the fried calamari perfectly. My boyfriend said he has had really good Tom yum from Thailand once, and said that was the best Tom yum he had ever had, but he said the creamy Tom yum noodles was almost equivalent to that he had at Thailand! The flavors of the Thai basil beef was amazing, my only complaint was the string beans to be blanched for a bit longer. The Thai tea was also perfect and one of the best Thai teas I've had in Philadelphia.",1

Incredible Rum drink called ""Shining Star"" made from The Real McCoy 3-year, one of my fave rums. ingredients were Rinomato Aperitivo, Ginger, Lime, Pineapple. $12. 

Oh. the pasta. The Tomato leaf bucatini...

I will also say that it's pretty overpriced.  The service is very good and the people are nice.  Also, it feels a little crowded inside so don't plan to bring a huge party.  On Friday/Saturday evenings, expect a long wait (which I always consider a good sign).  Given that it's located in a shopping plaza, parking is not an issue.",1

My kids love driving the little hand carts around and picking out a treat (usually one of the Pocky varieties).

I love the variety of miso pastes, curries, and tofus.  Also, this is one of the best place to come for large packages of herbs like basil!  You'll pay 1/4 of the price of a Sobeys or Safeway.

You can snag some great deals here but you can also pay way too much so you need to know your comparable price points.  The worst thing about this market is the ridiculous parking lot.  Be wary and watch out for crazy drivers and parking spots tighter than your pants after Xmas dinner!

  My wife had one selection of their schnitzel. This one had German meet Hawaii.  A pork schnitzel with ham and pineapple.  The portion was huge and the taste was amazing.

5339292,5,"While hosting a weekend golf tournament, one of my players suddenly and sadly passed away as a result of a heart attack. 

His longtime friend (who was also playing in my event), informed me of the news first thing in the morning just hours before we were all meeting at the golf course.

As a regular customer, I called Buds, Blooms & Beyond even before they were actually open that morning and Bradley still answered the phone. Despite the late notice and it being a busy week for him with people taking care of their admins, he respected my situation and enthusiastically agreed to put something together for my tournament.

Within 90 minutes (and Bradley even offered to do it sooner if necessary), I picked up exactly the arrangement needed and it was beautifully done.

We placed the flowers on the empty golf cart that he and his longtime friend were assigned for my event and parked it all day on the third tee, which was the hole they were scheduled to play to start my tournament. Every other group also hit an extra ball on that third hole in his memory as if he was with playing with them.

Thanks to Bradley at Buds, Blooms and Beyond, I hope we did a nice thing for a man who was supposed to be out there with us enjoying this great game on a beautiful Florida day.",1

In each case, she told us what care or treatment options were available and she gave recommendations when we asked for them.  When our dogs got old and sick, Dr. Jill euthanized them with loving care.  She cares deeply about the pets in her care and their owners.  Our experiences were always 5-star, and when we have our next pets, we will take them straight to her.

The chicken wings can fix my day almost any day, and the mandoo is a great starter also.  But for me it is always that the veggies have been steamed perfectly, like how do they manage that everytime?

The cream cheese is easy to spread (not an issue for everyone but makes the experience that much better) and also make a good dip for the bagel chips. Definitely a go to bagel place if you're in the area.,1
1199954,4,"Small quaint restaurant on Market St.  We arrived late after 8pm and were seated right away. Waitress was very nice, informative and accommodating. I gave 3 stars for the following reasons:
1. I ordered the Morning Glory burger. I had to order the scrapple on the side and it was still to big to try and manage. 
2. Bread crumpled and was not accommodating for a 8oz burger. Bread type and flavor wasn't impressive. 
3. Bacon was thick and a bit dry. 
4. Fries were not fresh. We barely ate them. 

The burger meat was good quality and tasted very good I will say that. The egg was cooked perfectly on my burger as well and the swiss cheese complimented well. 

I will probably return because I really want to try the desserts/milkshakes . I was honestly overstuffed from the burger to order anything else. 

Update few days later: I added another star. The owner seems humble and stated most everything on the menu is made in house. Umm the milkshakes are fabulous...so good :)",1
5333580,4,"I've passed this little shop many a time. What a treat it was today at lunchtime to finally have the opportunity to check it out.

It's located in the sleepy town of Safety Harbor at 308 Main Street (590) and 3rd Ave., South. It's a very short walk from the Safety Harbor Resort and Spa.

As other reviewer's have stated, it's a very small shop with limited seating in the rear. There are some tables for eating outside also.

As of late, my new obsession is for the Muffaletta sandwich. I've tried several sandwich shops to no avail for what I would call a very good Muffaletta sandwich. Well, on this day I found my favorite. They call it a ""Muffalittle"", but trust me it's not a little sandwich. It's constructed on what they call a moon pie roll. Which is a quite large circular roll. The contents are salami, Tavern ham, provolone, and homemade olive salad and mayonnaise, it's then hot pressed. The word delicious doesn't do this sandwich justice.

I can't wait to go back there to try some of their other creations it's well worth the trip to Safety Harbor.",1

The steak chunks inside were so tasty! Usually the quality of the meat in inexpensive restaurants can be a hit or miss, but this was great! The pico de gallo was delicious too. One of the best burritos I have ever had! The service could have been better though. Our server was efficient and quick, and while she wasn't unfriendly, she wasn't friendly either.",1

We came because of the all the positive reviews and the prices here. We were kind of surprised about the interior. It's REAL basic. Looks like a college dorm cafeteria with lots of cheap chairs and tables spread out. Waiters walk around with a trolley like on an airplane cleaning up tables.
Food was great. Pho and spring rolls were fantastic. Also ordered the shrimp clay pot and lemon grass chicken along with 2 vietnamese beers to wash it all down. All was just great and for under $40 you just can't beat it. Now that they are open until 3 A.M. we have a new place to go at midnight if we get hungry instead of some all night overpriced coffee shop in the casinos.",1

4902285,5,"I've been anticipating the opening of The Little Donut and it's finally here. I'm excited to say it was totally worth the wait!!!! We ordered a half dozen-large variety of classics and new tastes. Today we picked a chocolate creamer filled, orange frosted and strawberry frosted, cinnamon crumb, red velvet and a cookies and cream. All were amazing. First words out of my husbands mouth when he tasted the cookies and cream, ""oh god"" hahaha. And from me, ""mmmm"" with every bite of each donut Of course, I didn't eat all in one sitting; took a few bites of each. 

The texture was perfect. A nice crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside. The amount of frosting per donut was the right amount. My fav donut is and will always be chocolate cream-filled; that's just how I roll. 

They do have some drinks if you're thirsty: coffee, milk, soda l, juice and water. 

I apologize for not getting pictures of the inside. I was too excited and rushed home to taste. It won't be the last time I visit so more pics to come. The inside is modern and I love that you can see the kitchen and the owner working hard back there. Cute little succulents as centerpieces caught my eye-too cute!!!

The service was very friendly. Today there were three lovely ladies working the front. Glad they were knowledgeable and happily helped us make selections.",1

6089037,5,"Popped in for a casual lunch and not only was the food incredible but the service was better than any I can remember.  We were greeted with genuine smiles at the hostess desk and taken right to a table, our waitress (Cori) was an absolute DELIGHT - she found the perfect balance of being helpful and efficient without being intrusive. She made some great recommendations (seriously, try the sweet potato fries with a side cup of balsamic - you'll die!) and her cheerful banter made our experience even better.   My friend ordered the Ranch Hand Burger w/sweet potato fries and I ordered the Pressed Cuban w/ house-made chips.  We split everything and had a feast!  Although those orders could be considered ordinary it's the premium ingredients that take the flavor up about ten notches...the bread, the capicola on the burger, the incredibly tender braised pork and the pickled pepper relish on my Cuban...these were no ordinary sandwiches. My taste buds did a celebratory dance!  I can't remember the last time a SANDWICH was so rich and flavorful.   We didn't order any alcoholic beverages so I can't speak for the craft beers or yummy-looking coladas on the menu.  If you're looking for a casual lunch or dinner in a beautiful atmosphere with exceptional service and really delicious food - look no further! The Goat is my new favorite place - I'm thrilled they've come to Mt. Juliet. Can't wait to try the Sunday brunch!",1

I called today and a sweet woman named Libby answered the phone. I described the piece and she went as far as to text me pictures of what they had in the store so I didn't have to make an extra trip to be disappointed. Very impressed with the dress I bought before and after the level of customer service shown to me today, I will definitely be returning for more!! And for the naysayers in the previous comments about return policies and store credit, they definitely made sure I knew the policy and even had me initial a copy of my receipt to show that they had gone over it with me.

5184903,4,"Good food is had at this mostly take-out restaurant owned in partnership by owners of Archie's food truck and Bar Gernika.  The creative menu is as you might expect if you imagined the best of both those worlds served up in one store front.  Our first meal from Manfred's kitchen was delicious.  We're eager to try more. 

THE DRILL:  Although the interior of Manfred's is not quite complete when it is it will have a take out counter and offer half a dozen-ish seats at two levels of built in counter seating in a shoe box sized space.  Right now and in the future you can order Manfred's food from their menu at Woodland Empire Ale next door. You can do 'to-go' or take a seat at one of Woodland's picnic tables inside or out or at the high counter seats inside and the food will be delivered when ready.  Service is on paper and styrofoam using plastic utensils.

HOURS: Manfred's kitchen is open  Tues - Sat from 11a-2p and then again from 5-10p.  As news spreads of the great food being served at such good price points I imagine there will be lines of people to enjoy it.  Advice is go early for lunch or dinner hour to avoid the inevitable crush.

MENUS & FOOD:  I posted menu photos to show the breadth of options; vegetarians and omnivores both have good choices.  For our first lunch today we savored a trifecta of daily specials:
*Green gazpacho, just spicy enough from hot peppers and green and smooth from avocado and cilantro and topped with a dice of sweet onion,
*Splendidly seasoned lamb shwarma wrapped in a perfect pita, and
*Salted chocolate balls which were a half dozen small chocolate filled croquettes cooked just right and served just right warm with a spicy hot raspberry dipping sauce.  

VALUE:  Prices run from roughly $4 to $10.  Total bill $16 and two of us were well fed.

HOSPITALITY:  A very nice guy associated with Manfred's let us look around inside at the work in progress when we were too clueless to note the signs on the door clearly pointing towards Woodland Empire as the location to place our order and eat and walked into Mandred's instead.  Super friendly service by the Woodland host behind the bar there helped make the marvelous Manfred's food taste even better.

LIBATIONS:  Woodland Empire has a plethora of beers and ales and a couple of wines in cans but given lunch hour and meetings to follow we passed up the beverages. 

PARKING:  There is a tiny lot and even with only seven people, including us, in for lunch it was full.  Don't plan on parking being available there

ACCESSIBILITY:   Mixed bag.  Woodland Empire is level in the door.  The loo is accessible too.   Two small round 'two top' outside tables are accessible.  But neither the interior standard height picnic table seating nor the high counter height tables meets the mere minimum requirements of Federal Civil Rights law of ADA to provide seating for the (11%) minority population of people with mobility disability.  The ADA turned 26 years old last week.  Plenty enough time for owners to get it right.  If the (11%) minority population of African Americans were denied a place to sit and eat inside everyone would ""get it"".  I think of the young Vet I met using a wheelchair because his legs were severed in Iraq.  He ""gets it"" when he doesn't have equal access to a seat at the table.  We all should.",1

339825,5,Finally Green Hills has a new and fantastic place to dine!  We visited Char for Saturday brunch and was a wonderful experience all around!  We started with the Gumbo and it was full of flavor and a perfect start.  The crab benedict is lump crab meat and excellent flavor but our favorite was the Southern Benedict with fried green tomatoes and country ham.  The service at the bar was spectacular and both bartenders were great to talk with and truly enjoyed the entire experience.  As local Green Hills residents we are SO happy you are in the neighborhood and will be back often!,1
133535,5,"Damn fine sushi! Everything was great from the sunomono starter to the final piece of sushi. The scallop sushi was my favorite with its pure simplicity and super fresh scallop that just melted in my mouth. This was served with just a tiny sliver of lemon to squeeze just before devouring. The mackerel was a phenomenal piece of fish with a beautiful iridescent skin and tender flesh. The rolls we enjoyed ranged from the Key West with conch pieces strewn about, the Snow White with flaky tempura pieces topping the tasty roll. The Red Angel with perfectly fried shrimp and a Siracha mayo. The absolute best roll was the Green Angel with each flavor mixing with the next and standing on it's own at the same time. When you first bite into it you get the rice with toasted sesame seeds then you delve deeper and get the fresh tuna and finally the wasabi mayo that tops this just makes you have a foodgasm at the table. To end the evening with one last taste we asked if the sushi chef would make us a couple of spicy scallop hand rolls, they did so with no hesitation and it was the perfect end to the meal. The scallops as mentioned earlier were about as fresh as if you shucked them yourself. The pieces were substantial and delicate tossed in a nice spicy sauce that only enhanced the flavor of the scallops and not masking them in any way. 

I have been enjoying sushi for many years and this was an eye opening meal as far as what sushi should be. I'm afraid Toki may have ruined me for all others.",1
1350977,5,"When I want to test a sushi bar, I always go for the chef's choice. For those not familiar, usually the chef's choice comes with several kinds of nigiri and sometimes a roll or sashimi on the side. Koto knocks this test out of the park every time. Oh the rolls are good too, but I have only tried a couple. Expect them to contain fresh fish and be skillfully assembled. I also like the broiled squid - I know not for everyone but you should try it!

In each of my visits, I've only had one waitress and she always had the whole restaurant. She was still fast and friendly on a busy evening. I've only visited for dinner, when it's easy to be seated quickly even with a relatively full dining room.

Prices are competitive to slightly lower than other sushi restaurants. Like other restaurants in the area, there is no dedicated free parking. However, after six and on weeknights (without major events), free parking is easy to find on the streets within a couple blocks.",1
2257035,4,"I was thrilled to find this lunch buffet right down the street from our companies new office. Im sure it will quickly become a staple, with a wide variety of dishes that are all above the normal american-chinese average.

245397,3,"This was my first time trying gia' s. In my opinion the pizza was a bit pricey and it wasn't worth what I paid for it.  I got the bbq wings and a 12 inch pizza.  The wings were pretty good but my pizza was a little bit on the dry side. I asked for extra cheese and I don't believe I got it.  I would definitely say if you don't like sweet pizza sauce then this pizza isn't for you, other than that the customer service was good.

6413459,5,"Leaving Gainesville, I was definitely devastated because I was leaving my favorite boba place: Lollicup. Don't get me wrong, there are some good boba places around Tampa but none of them quite hit the spot for me... That is until boba cup opened up! What makes it better is the owner is the same owner as the boba place I use to go to! 

It's a small little place with very friendly staff. The drinks are very customizable. You can mix and match, adjust the sweetness level to your liking, and of course add different ingredients to the bottom. 

There's a variety of different drinks : slushes, milk teas, bubble tea, ( the usuals at a boba place) etc. so there's a bit for everyone. However my favorite is the tastea fruitea. It's teas with a lot of different things in it other then boba! Often times there's about 3-4. For example it may have strawberry bits, boba, and basil seeds. And the flavor combo is great. 

What really makes this place stand out is the small snacks and desserts they carry. The shaved ice is very smooth and not too sweet. There are macaroons shipped straight from New York and the flavors they have are super yummy. But the newest desert is a Hong Kong waffle. If you haven't tried it yet, make sure you get it! It's a semi sweet waffle with little balls instead of your usual squares. Its crunchy on the outside, but soft and airy when you bite into it. You then can chose one of the four ice cream flavors they have and a topping ( the mango sorbet with fresh kiwi is my fave).",1

2474577,3,"I love Tapas and stopped in for dinner after work with my SO. The space is open and beautiful, and I had a tough time deciding what to order. We had a bubbly waiter who was a bit goofy but did a decent job with our meal. 
We ordered the gin drink with egg whites and sampled the crab toast, plantain, and lamb. The drink was good (but a bit sweet for my SO). The crab toast overall had a solid flavor but the crab tasted like it came out of a can and not fresh. The plantain had a delicious center with chorizo and manchego but the outside was dry and flavorless. It definitely needed more of the filling. The highlight of the whole meal was the lamb. It was perfectly cooked and we loved the eggplant/chickpea mixture! It was fantastic! 
We split the entrée and went for the pasta, bucatini with pork/lamb ragu. In case you don't know, bucatini is a mixture of spaghetti and macaroni (aka really long macaroni). Once again it was a bit of a let down but was much better once we asked for sides of pecorino. However, I only had a few bites and we were not blown away by this dish either. 
Overall there were more misses during the meal and I'm not itching to go back. However, I am always tempted by tapas so maybe I'll come back and give them another shot in the future.",1

If you're expecting Cow and the Curd status yumminess, you'll probably be as let down as I was.  Don't get me wrong. I still ate my share. Because, you know, fried cheese. But they were not quite the tasty ""light little poufs"" that I was hoping for.

However, atmosphere is fantastic. Love me a good spot for some outdoor drinking, as well as a good place to wet my whistle while out of towner guests brave the madness that is the Liberty Bell line. But the price point did seem a wee bit high to me.  Also, I was expecting my watermelon sangria to be light and refreshing, but it was sickeningly sweet instead.  

I'd come back, but I'd probably just stick with ordering a beer. Now there's a novel thought, Shauna. Beer at a beer garden. Genius.",1

I had the center cut filet which was so good; however, I was not a fan of the potatoes it came with.  My boyfriend had their signature dish, which was the sea bass, it was not amazing but was satisfying... I was not a big fan of the sauce.  Desserts were unbelievably amazing! MMM...

In addition to their organization is the phenomenal steals you find and for such reasonable prices. Everything I find here is priced so great I never feel like I'm over paying and they just make you feel like they are catering to those of us who just love the music.

This store is phenomenal and you must check it out soon.

Also, they sell vinyl sleeves which are important!!!",1

Lots of great breakfast options. The tacos were delicious and the sausage and cheddar kolache was on point! The bread on the kolache was sweet and eggy, like a brioche or a challah, great balance to the spicy, savory, sausage. Also lots of great sweet options. One day I had the cinnamon roll, it was HUGE and so tasty. I also had the cream cheese kolache. Not a disappointing thing on the menu. Definitely stop by if your in the neighborhood.",1

5796624,5,"Classy.  Great Service.  GREAT food.  Great Atmosphere.  Moderate prices.  Original dishes.  Frazer's has all of these and more, which makes it one of the best restaurants in St. Louis.  

I don't even know where to begin, because I love everything here.  The specials.  Frazer's has just as many specials every single night as the do regular menu items, and they are always coming up with new favorites on the menu.  If you are looking for a best kept secret, this place is one of the most underrated seafood restaurants in town.  I've had the Salmon Frazer, and it is excellent - fresh, great flavor.  

Another best kept secret at Frazer's is the STEAKBURGER!!!!  Quite possibly the best burger I have ever eaten.  Ever.  Steak and Shake needs to take a lesson, becuase, because this is a real steakburger.  They make it fresh there at Frazer's, and it is juicy, succulent, and full of flavor.  

I've had the steak, the duck, the meatloaf, the chicken - and many more and I feel like I haven't even tried half of the great dishes Frazer's has.  What more can hungry guy ask for!?!

The wine list is fairly extensive and the drinks are fairly priced, and I've heard the bartender makes a pretty original drink, but I haven't tried it.  I am always so impressed by the servers here.  There is always at least 10-12 specials from salads, soups, and entrees, and the servers can always describe each one in very fine and intricate detail.  Best service staff in St. Louis.  They almost always offer a vegetarian and vegan option, so they cater to all crowds.  With the brewery in the backdrop, this place breathes St. Louis like no other place in town.  I just can't say enough good things about this place.  If I had a restaurant, I would want it to be Frazer's.  If I ever get to meet this person who they call Frazer, my only words would be ""Well Done Sir.""",1
1710690,4,"I stayed here while on a business trip.  
It is walkable close to many restaurants. There is a coffee shop with light foods, but no restaurant on site. (Etc is a great restaurant right around the corner though). The rooms are nice and not cramped. Two queen beds in the room and still plenty of room. We had a microwave and fridge in the room - tucked away behind a door. There are a good supply of outlets and USB charging stations. Nice decor. 

The lobby is well designed with plenty of seating - worked well for meetings. 

The people working were most helpful and polite. 

Parking is by valet. $20 / night. I would have liked to see other options but for where it is located, it was fine. And, it was quick and easy. 

I liked the hotel and would stay again. Especially for business.",1

2087923,5,"FINALLY got a chance to try them out after waiting for so long. The past couple of times I've been in the area there's always been a line going out of the parking lot and around the block. This day, it was fate! I got there first in line even though they've been open for at least 3 hours. I was worried I was there too early but luckily they do breakfast until 11am and lunch all day. I'll try the breakfast next time.
So, I ordered the Big Piece meal which is a chicken sandwich with bacon, lettuce, and tomato. It came with crinkle fries and a drink. I also ordered the Fowl ball which is the vegan chicken sandwich for my fiance. I tasted my sandwich and I'm so happy to say it was worth the wait. I really loved the crispiness but still juicy bite to the chicken. I also happened to go back to order another sandwich and the banana pudding parfait as I was still in the parking lot. I had to get the Nashville Hot chicken sandwich. It was quite spicy so if you like it spicy, that's the chicken sandwich for you! My fiance loved the vegan chicken sandwich and was instantly a fan of the banana pudding. 
Hopefully I'll be back again sooner than later cuz I do want to try more of their menu items.",1

3986471,4,"For a small mom & pop Thai food store in Havertown, the food here is pretty good! It provides many of the Thai staples you would find, including Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, various fried rices, and of course, curry! 

In regards to their food, I have had their Drunken Noodles, Pad See Ieu, and Basil Fried Rice, and I would say they were all delicious! What really made me happy was the portion size; they provide A LOT and basically fill the container to the brim (great for those who eat a lot)! I do think they can improve the Drunken Noodles by using more basil since I didn't get that taste until I was finishing the second half of the dish, but overall the dish is still rather good. I haven't tried their curry, but I can't wait to do so. I believe for most of their dishes, you can indicate the spicy level when you order, which is great for those who want it very spicy or very mild. The prices are appropriate for what they provide, though I would be happier if it was $1-2 dollars cheaper (or better yet, a lunch menu). 

The store is rather small and currently limited in seating (which I don't think they are offering due to COVID). It has a small parking lot, so easy to pick up To-Go orders, and you can order through various platforms. They did admit once that they couldn't find the indicated time for pick up when you order through Yelp, so be wary and make sure they know when you're picking up the food. Also, make sure you look in your bag for utensils if wanted them; they're happy to provide them, but sometimes forget. 

Rating: 8/10 (points off for all the small things noted above)
Pros: Food is super tasty, flavorful, and FILLING
Cons: Pick-Up/Utensil Confirmation Issues",1

4701197,4,"I was so very pleasantly surprised by this place! I'd driven by it a million times without ever stopping in, but recently, the girlfriend and I were craving seafood and didn't feel like driving too far into town to satiate our craving, so we gave it a try. And we were so satisfied! We started by splitting a dozen chargrilled oystahs, which were buttery and garlicky and perfectly piping hot. We followed that by splitting a combo platter of delectable fried shrimp and hearty stuffed mirliton (an unsung, local tradition that's RARELY seen in restaurants in the area). The entree came with a small side salad, which obviously we ignored in favor of the fried goods. The seafood quality is great, and they have every option for which you could wish. It's admittedly pricey, in that combo plates don't run under $20, but they're sharable and indisputably delicious. There's also a surprisingly extensive local beer selection (they had my favorite Andygator!). Service was prompt and no-frills. Plus there's a massive gator sculpture outside that's perfect if you're about that instagram lyfe.  Will definitely come back with the fam. Poboys and lunch plates are reasonably priced at $10-13, so will likely try that next time! Very enjoyable.",1

So, it's a bit on the small side, but it's packed with a rather large menu of breakfast fare and lunch items.  Tradition runs the gamut here with all the top 10 hits and more from the American menu hit parade.  Eggs, breakfast Burritos, biscuits and gravy.. and of course Burgers and sandwiches.   I had the traditional 2 egg breakfast and my wife had a breakfast burrito.  Hearty portions are served here, so save some weekly calories before coming in for a bite.  I never order this, but I did get the biscuit with gravy with my meal.  It was good, although a little too much pepper in the gravy, but still tasty.  Although busy, they took my name and texted me in 20 minutes.  No problem.   It was the weekend.  The interior is bright, bathrooms clean, and the staff were very friendly.    I would advise you stop in, then squeeze in, for some good comfort food.  You may even bump into the mayor here.  He's quite the regular.   Last word?  Recommended.",1

Trying to get ice cream already.

I've been wanting to try this new phenomenon for a while, and what better day than national ice cream day? Well apparently 40 other people (including a screaming baby and his dad who was slowly getting a sunburn as we waited) thought so too. From about 30 feet from the entrance the wait was AN HOUR LONG. The ice cream is good but it's not waiting in line at Disney world for an upside down roller coaster good. It's not 2/3 of a Pixar movie good. 

You'll have time to decide in line but for those who have choice anxiety: you pick a base (ice cream, froyo, vegan ice cream), then you can build your own or do one of their premade things (strawberry cheesecake, smore, nutella banana, cinnamon toast crunch, etc.) (This gets mixed in) they spread it out, it looks cool (literally),  it's almost performance art, tbh, they roll it all fancy and if you're lucky they'll write your name in cursive chocolate, and then you can add unlimited toppings! (Ok but think about how many toppings you could add for $7 at your regular ice cream/froyo place, that's right,  this ice cream is the price of a burrito, might have to be a chamillionaire if you're coming here a lot).

Tl;dr: Delicious, choose your own adventure with vegan option,  fresh tasting, cool experience,  but kinda overpriced, and I'm never waiting in this line again. Go at off peak hours or just don't go.",1

3306171,4,"Since it was my daughter's birthday and she really likes Japanese food, we decided to try out this restaurant. Due to Covid-19, we called ahead to make sure that dining in was available and made reservations.  We were greeted immediately and were requested to use the hand sanitizer before being seated.  The tables were spaced apart with only a few tables to accommodate the maximum group of 6 customers.

The ambiance is modern with a few Japanese pictures posted along the bar area which is located in the middle of the restaurant.  The restaurant lighting is soft with music playing but was still quiet inside.  The two unisex washrooms are big, bright and clean with square toilets.  There were also Japanese wall hangings inside.

We ordered a few items to share, my favourites were the hotmate spicy tuna roll and the pancake.  The rolls were so fresh tasting and didn't need wasabi or soy sauce.  The pancake was nice and hot, under the mound of egg covered goodness were yakisoba noodles and vegetables with a sauce.  Definitely would suggest this dish!  The seafood yakisoba was just okay, needed sauce or more salt or spices, a little disappointing.  The pork katsu sando looked amazing!  Big pieces in toasted bread with fries and coleslaw, even the fries were super delicious!  The spicy miso ramen was a thick broth full of flavour, it was quite good and I'm not a Japanese ramen fan since many restaurant servings are small and not worth the money I find.  The prices here are reasonable.

There's street parking all over and free parking in a lot south of Jasper Ave.  Service was good, the servers were efficient and our food came out in a timely manner.  This location opened a year ago and there's also one on Whyte Ave.",1

4752065,5,"I live pretty close to the Westbank Pho Bang, so I have been a fan for years. I think Pho Bang is some of the best pho in the city and, while other people like to worship at the altar of Tan Dinh, I regularly go to Pho Bang for my #14 large and spring rolls.

I was out in Metairie, around lunch, when I saw that a Pho Bang had opened on Vets. Now, that every location is owned by a member of the same family, so the menu is pretty much the same.

I stopped in here and ordered my large pho tai gau (eye-round steak, flank, and brisket), egg rolls and spring rolls.

As expected, my pho tai gau was as good as ever. There's just something about the pho here that's just amazing- it's a real cure all. If you feel sick, this stuff will cure you. The egg rolls were crunchy perfection and the pork spring rolls were excellent.

The service here is always fast, so it's perfect for lunch and this location has a little bit of an edge on my regular pho bang, because this one has banh mih.

If you become a member use them or lose them. I lost a lot of visits and it ended up being a waste of money for me I only got 3 solid visits out of 16 ""visits"" that I paid for. Didn't feel good about that!!!! They are Always busy from 12-1 the only time I could go but the wait was too long... Plan to go regularly or do NOT become a member unless you enjoy throwing money away. If visits are unused they will Not roll over to another month and you cannot gift visits to family or friends.... I didn't bother trying to get my insurance to cover it - too much paperwork for a 5 min adjustment...it's Just like a gym membership if you don't go you'll still pay so plan on going if you become a member, if not don't bother it will end up costing more than the regular one time visit. However If you need it - go!! they will pop you good.

Chris, thanks your for response. It would have been very nice to hear about the other packages available for people like me that cannot go once a week due to schedule conflicts. Maybe train the receptionist to be more mindful of your customers!",1

5673357,4,"Very good Tennessee style bbq. I had the sampler platter. A whole lot of food even for a bubba. The ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket were top notch. The pork chop, while tasty, was very dry. Coleslaw is the creamy variety and better than most. We travel in an RV so I'm hopeful that the leftovers will fit in the fridge.",1
6334759,4,"Nice restaurant with great table-side-made sangria. Seriously, their special sangria, a mixture of fresh fruits, cinnamon, brandy and red wine, is alone worth the visit.

The escargot is traditional and tasty. The Red Snapper Papillot is quite good as well. Truthfully, their dinner specials are what shine. I have had anything from seared tuna with wasabi mashed potatoes to lobster papillot.. all of it good. On the downside, their yellow rice is a bit bland.

Service is attentive and quick. Atmosphere, while not overly dressy, is not overly casual either.",1
1473805,5,I met Joe and Kathleen while I was walking a dog. They were very personable. I saved the business card and used their services to clean 2 couches and a club chair. The price was more than reasonable and the furniture looked like it was new again. They are very knowledgeable about stains and the products they use. Don't hesitate to call them.,1

4446955,3,"Very clean facility. Lots of TVs for game days. Great hangout areas such as couches. We had two waiters. Wasn't sure if they were both in training or one was training the other, because they both seemed very new. Not very personable at all. Asked us how the check was split up two bites into our burgers... They seemed a little rushed or as if they wanted us to leave, let me mention there was only 4 tables in the restaurant and it was 4pm on a Sunday. We all got the burgers and they were very good. We ordered beer cheese that never came out and they thought it was okay to bring our appetizer  after the main course. We will never just come here for food. If we come back it's for drinks before the movie and we will only be dealing with the bartender which I hope is better.",1
1427574,5,"Having moved to the US from England 14 years ago what we have always missed the most is a good Indian restaurant. They really are few and far between in my opinion. Well Nashville has a gem! This was our first visit and it lived up to all the good reviews. Great ambiance, excellent service and the food was fantastic. We shared the Naan/ Chutney starter plate (extra bread brought by our attentive waiter Adam). I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and My wife Nicky had the Vegetable Korma. The food was fresh and tasty and reasonably priced. Like most of the best restaurants (in my experience) the menu is simple and with limited options that are all done well. Whether you are a meat eater or Vegetarian there will be something for you. Highly recommend a visit.",1
4431871,5,"Great service, detailed, convenient and eco friendly. What more can you ask for in a car detail shop? 

Ownership changed a while back and they breathed new life into this car wash. The concept is already genius; get your car cleaned while you shop or catch a movie at Citrus Park mall. What's changed is the level of professionalism. The techs who handle your car understand customer service and pay attention to detail.

This location is close to my home, so we've used them a couple of times now and plan to keep coming back.",1
4908350,5,"From the homemade Satan' to the best vegan pizza I've ever had, this place is the sh*t! I had the sweet spicy wings and a slice of Philly pizza and it was so good. Since the Satan and everything Is made with kosher and the finest vegan ingredients, its light on the stomach. We went on a Sunday, no line and it was chill. These guys are killing it!

1767935,3,"this is a great place if you have a family. With pool, gym and childcare most families can enjoy the ammenities. The classes are decent but vary in regards to difficulty and quality based on the instructor. It's ridiculously crowded after 4pm on weekday, otherwise I rarely have to wait for equipment with the exception of the stair steppers (of which only 4 are available). The staff is friendly and the equipment varys from newer elliptical machines to ancient stair steppers. I recommend this gym, that being said; if I was single under 50 I may feel different about it. Just on a humorous note. You will usually find doughnuts being served in the mornings at this gym which really cracks me up.:-)",1

1592361,4,"i love the dessert pizzas here...ahhhh nothing can beat cinnamon on a pizza with icing!!!  it is the best and is reason to go to this pizza place.  seriously.....the pizza is good too, but the dessert is awesome!  after having a few slices of pizza and then moving on to the dessert....it is great...but a major carbo-load!!!!   you can get whole wheat crust if you like or stick with the usual.  they use high quality ingredients too.  it's a very dry pizza, if you're into that thing.  i like that because i'm into the health thing too, as are many santa barbarans.  i mean, i want a good flavorful pie, but if it is sopping with grease it is not happening with me.  it will just make me feel sick ingesting all of that saturated fat (i.e. rusty's, domino's or round table).  woodstocks is a different type of pizza than Giovanni's....both are great.  i would say woodstocks is more fun to hang out in and eat or watch a game and gio's is better for take out.",1
3646153,5,This is the best pizza ever!  We drove over an hour today for 2 large pies.  The crust is so flaky and good!  We wish it was closer but to us definitely worth the ride!  Awesome!  Be sure to try the breadsticks too... Best red sauce!,1
3481567,5,"I'm not a wine drinker but I'm so thankful to have found this place!
I wanted to pick up some wine while on my day trip to Santa Barbara to give as gifts and I could not have had a better experience.
I had a little trouble finding the location because Google Maps had other ideas about where it was located but when I called the shop, the owner was so helpful in giving me directions.
Once there, I told the owner that I wanted a Liquid Farms Chardonnay, since that is what my friend said she liked, and he found me two bottles in the blink of an eye. I said that my friend liked a more mineral taste and he immediately knew which Chardonnay that would be. I was thoroughly impressed. 
I also told the owner that I wanted to get a Cabernet Sauvignon for my mother and he picked one out in the price range that I was looking for. My mother was thrilled with her wine and even mentioned on how famous the winery is.
All in all, I had a great experience and everyone looking for wine in Santa Barbara should stop by.",1
1282550,3,"This hotel is located across the interstate from the entrance to the Boise Airport. It shares a parking lot with the Holiday Inn so check that reservation closely. It also has an Applebee's in the parking lot for a dining option. 

The hotel meets the expectations of the Holiday Inn Express chain. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. I did not experience any noise issues while staying there. The breakfast in the morning included hot and cold items. 

Located about 10 minutes from downtown and the university, this hotel was convenient to where I needed to be.",1

5181061,5,"This is one of the best strip clubs I've been to in years. 

First, the girls actually dance. They don't mail it in, they actually have rhythm and they clearly have pole skills. You don't get inversions, suspensions or spirals in most clubs. Every girl who goes up on stage puts on a show. It's worth it just to sit and watch them for an hour or two while you drink.

Second, there is actually some variety to the women. They are not all bony, blondes with boob jobs (try to say that five times fast). There is a diversity in race, height, shape and body modification. If you want all your strippers to come from Eastern Europe (which seems to be the trend these days) you might be overwhelmed here.

Finally, there is no hassle or pressure here. Girls will offer a dance, but they won't push if they're not what you are looking for. The prices are no higher than any other normal bar in the area and security isn't constantly looking at you as if your standing in the prison yard with a shank in your hand. It is a place you can actually relax and enjoy yourself.

I haven't been to a strip club in NYC as good as Deja Vu. NOLA can be proud of its achievement. 

Have fun.

6110236,5,"We took a ghost tour with Christie -- it was terrific!  First of all, there was a full moon which added to the creepiness.  Then there was Christie who is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about paranormal activity and the city of New Orleans.  What was most impressive about her stories was that she didn't seem to be 'performing' - she was giving us information about real people/events that just happened to be scary as all heck!  I highly recommend this tour!  Bea made sure all the logistics were organized and Christie made sure all of our hearts were racing from eerie tales.",1
522264,3,"When we first moved to the area, we started ordering from here.  The food was amazing and the staff were very pleasant.  Unfortunately, over time the service and food have declined.  I am unsure if there was a change over in staff or a shortage in staff, but our food has gotten worse each time.  We love their pizza.  The crust is buttery and crisp and the ingredients are fresh.  The last two orders of pizza were burnt, there was a huge bubble that took up a third of the pizza, and the toppings did not taste as fresh or was missing.  It was delivered to our home, so by the time we saw the food, it was too late.  We were hungry and did not want to wait for another pizza.  My last order there was the buffalo chicken cheese steak and a tossed salad with chicken.  The sandwich was very good, it was on a fresh roll and not too spicy.  The salad was a disappointment.  The chicken was terrible, it was all fatty pieces and the salad did not contain all the ingredients described online.  I ordered extra honey mustard and it was very watery. Their honey mustard usually is very good, very thick and creamy.  What they made that day seemed extremely watered down.  Because of this last disappointment, we decided to start ordering elsewhere.",1
1715388,5,"We already have an iMac, but try to understand how my husband suffers because he can't carry that around. (Yes, note my sarcastic tone). Nevermind that he has a work MacBook . . . that's for work. He NEEDS one where he could write IPhone apps and be able to carry around. Geesh, is that so hard to understand? 
Anyway, this weekend we were those quintessential nightmare customers every sales person and/or customer service rep dreads. I have to say that the Apple crew took it all in stride and were amazing. I really, really try to never be that customer but my husband . . . . . 
He knew what he wanted even before we got there. Then we get there and he has the crew explain every single possible difference between the 13 inch notebook and the 15 inch notebook. Now, I KNOW he already knows all this, but he had them explain it him nonetheless like he was five years old. A long time later, he finally decides which one he wants and surprise, there's now a 17 inch. Let's go over everything once again. 
Finally, he chooses but how can he buy just that? He goes around the store picking out various accessories and software that he also wants a thorough description of. At last, time to pay . . . he forgot his card. This is an account he's had since college (before me) so I don't have one on me. I look in his wallet. I find it for him. It's expired. He calls the card company and asks them to extend the expiration date because he doesn't have the new one on him. They do. That takes another several minutes. The apple guys start ringing up the purchase to no avail. It can't be done. Their system doesn't allow that. I could've told him that. He asks them to hold everything for him and that we'd be back. We drive all the way over from La Encantada to Rita Ranch, find that card and drive back. We get there and the guy that was helping us had left. He put the things back. My husband goes around looking for everything again this time asking about printers and games. At this point I was about ready to kick him. The apple crew kids didn't look the least bit frustrated or annoyed and for that I should probably send them a fruit basket.",1

5687089,3,"The RV park is located in the city of Goodlettsville, only 12 miles from Nashville.  I wouldn't call this a ""resort"" as the name implies, but it's a nice little park with extremely friendly and helpful staff.  We were escorted to our site, and were also offered assistance with hookup (we didn't need it, but it was nice that they offered it).  

The management offers a fantastic home cooked, southern breakfast and dinner every weekend at a nominal price.  The food was fantastic, and if you're in to Karaoke, you can join in and sing your heart out every weekend!   The park also has a small store on the premises with basic items and a variety of beverages, including beer and wine.  RV-specific items are also available.

If you're interested in touring Nashville, you can book a Grayline tour when checking in and the bus will pick you up at the office!  They offer a variety of tours that include all of the main attractions, as well as tickets to major headliners at the famous Grand Ole Oprey.  No need to drive into the city and find a pickup location!   

The only downfall are the train tracks directly behind the campground.  Although the trains don't blow their horn, you hear their rumble as they pass, and on average, at least one train passes every hour!   Because we weren't able to book a park within Nashville itself, the convenience and short drive to the city made the train noise tolerable!",1
3706234,5,I can't get over how amazing this place is! We ordered just about everything on the menu for our dear friend's birthday. Everything was excellent. There was not a poor dish to be had. My favorites were the shrimp polenta appetizer and the ribeye and filet. Please give this place a chance. You will love it!!!,1
1602059,4,"Just picked up some Stracciatella from here. After reading reviews that the gelato could use some work, I decided to check it out for myself. I had never noticed this quaint little dig and passed it up. I noticed that there was no parking in front of it anyways. I parked on a nearby street and hustled to get back to it. Upon entering, I was greeted by a nice little shop with a different view. It was refreshing to see the overly cheesy Italian decor.  I scanned my surroundings quick, noticing that the customers were eyeing me.  I'm sure most of these people are locals of the mid-city area and aren't used to seeing people from Uptown in their neck of the city! I ignored them and proceeded to the counter. There, I was greeted warmingly by a server. She was super friendly, which made me relax. I no longer felt like an alien out of its spaceship. She conversed with me while fixing my gelato and rang me up in no time. I made sure to tip her well. 

The taste of my Stracciatella was strong. I like it that way. However, it is still second best to that at Bachio Di Roma in Baton Rouge. Overall, the place is nice enough for me to spend $13.00 on a quart of gelato :)",1
3478464,4,"Apparently a converted Dairy Queen, Los Patios has a very unique layout and decor. The first thing you notice when you walk in Are the various colors of the tables and chairs. Separating the dining area and the kitchen is a big wall that was obviously the counter of the DQ.

The prices are good in the specials are even better. They have beer and margarita deals for every day of the week. As for food, I ordered the wet burrito and it came out covered and delicious cheese, just as promised. While it was not the Burrito Gigante, it was still gigantic.

The service was good and the orders were accurate. I would definitely return if I were in the area and craving Mexican food.",1

They have a chef, everything is prepared fresh. I had a perfectly made Cuban and wife had a juicy chicken sandwich with the best crispy sweet potato fries we have ever had. Mac and cheese is delish and I got a side of homemade hot sauce for my Cuban that was excellent. They have sports on the tv's and full bar. Lots of Belgian beers and a Belgian chocolate counter.

246432,5,"After using another inspector for my previous house I choose to try a new one.  What attracted me to using Fifth Generation is that when on the phone he seemed very knowledgeable.  He also stated he was a builder by trade also which is always a good thing because they can usually tell how things were done if you have a question.  

Thomas showed up on time and ready to go, he did an extremely thorough job at the house I am looking to buy and I wouldn't hesitate in using him again or recommending him.  His price is also very fair also for the type of work he does.  

I would say on a professional level compared to some he's very energetic and has a ton of passion.  He speaks fast and you need to keep up with him.  I think maybe that can be viewed as different but honestly in the world we live in today it's nice to have someone with a personality like his.",1

5718417,4,"I love this zoo.  If you plan on making a few trips throughout the year, I would strongly recommend the family pass--it covers your admission, parking, and entry into their specials throughout their year (Halloween, Christmas, etc). If you are just visiting, know that it's pretty steep.  Because this is a private zoo, not city funded, you do have to shell out some $$.  

Other than the price, this place is great for families.  They offer dolphin shows, shark petting, a butterfly botanical garden, orangutan exhibit, giraffe feedings, cheetah races, adorable walruses, and so much more.

They also have several food choices, drink stands throughout, as well as restrooms always close by--with changing tables (thank goodness).  They also provide plenty of recycling stations, which I much appreciate.",1

5517513,3,"When all else fails, there is always Carrabba's. I enjoy eating at the restaurants in this chain. They are neat and clean, the service is reasonably good, the seating is comfortable and there is always parking.

I think it is worth three and a half stars on any day of the week. And that's not a bad score. Carrabba's is the Italian food equivalent of Cracker Barrel. It's like the one daggy T-shirt that you love but can't throw away. It's comfortable, familiar, sort of average, but always there and always reliable.

Tonight we had a little wine, a little beer, spag-bol, veal marsala and soup. It wasn't fantastic, it wasn't the best Italian food ever, Otto was friendly...but a little slow, but what the heck...look at the above list of adjectives and you know why we went and why we will keep going back.

If you want a good hearty meal, in a pleasant environment and you love tomatoes, Carrabba's is your destination.

As a footnote..I have been a little turned off by the advertising on TV of that disgusting cheese filled mess, masquerading as a monster meat ball which Carrabba's has been promoting. It is not the sort of thing anyone needs to put in their mouths.

6101359,5,"I both eat and deliver for this place (with a third party delivery app) and I highly recommend it.

Timely: If a restaurant makes you wait more than 5 minutes as a Delivery driver then your hourly average drops a lot. At 10 minutes of waiting you end up around minimum wage (you need to complete a certain volume of orders per hour to make any real money). With that being said, they almost always have the order/s ready at least a few minutes early and they don't de-prioritize Delivery orders like most places do. Fastest pizza place in town. 

Management: The owners are a husband wife team who actually seem to care about what they do and they actually remember my face and make me feel like part of the family lollll

The food: really good, get the cinnamon bites they're SO GOOD. The pizza is significantly better than most of the chains I've tried, they are faster than the chains, and it's nice to support small business.

Price: competitive with local chains

I have a lot of respect for a restaurant that treats third party app Delivery people like human beings lol which is why I started eating here, and now I'm addicted. 

No restaurant is perfect, but in all the times I've been here for pickup, if someone has ever had a problem with an order the owners themselves have gone out of the way to accommodate people and make things right. 

Highly recommend!",1

4340996,5,"Great, great pizza experience!

If you are looking for an ""out-of-the-ordinary"" pizza expereince, then you must go to Pizza-A-Go-Go!  They are located at 6703 Scanlan Avenue in South City - just South of I-44 off Arsenal exit.

We always get the Special large pizza - has all my favorites and I just love the crust.  What Paul does to the crust, I don't know, but I love it.  If you have a group of 4 or 6, I would recommend calling ahead and asking them to reserve a table for you - only has seating for about 25 or so in the restaurant, and you never know what will show up at the restaurant between the time to decide to go and you actually arrive.

Also, NO credit cards accepted - must pay with cash or check.  No salads, no appetizers, just great pizza!

It will soon become your favorite pizza place and they also have carry-out pizza too!  They are closed on Wednesday, but open any other day of the week!

You will LOVE it!!!!!",1

Though it seemed busy we were sat right away and just to mention it is a bit squished but it was fine.  We tried the ultimate fondue which was delicious. It came with your choice of two fondues we picked dark and milk. There was a ton to dip into the chocolate and a great sampling of what they have! It even came with marshmallows and a small personal fire for us to cool them! It came out really quickly and we didn't feel rushed at all. 

Would love to come back and try more of the menu. All of the food around us looked great. Waitress was also really nice and helpful with the menu selection !",1

But the last time I ate here my rueben was barely chewable and made me spend the rest of my friday night in the bathroom.

We almost left because we were so confused, but we decided to stay, and I am so glad we did.  We ordered the falafel balls as an appetizer, and those were amazing!!  Absolutely delicious -- probably the best falafel balls I've ever had.  For my entrée I ordered the lamb and beef kabobs which came with saffron rice and a side of hummus and pita.  The kabobs were flavorful and spicy; I chopped them up and mixed it up with the rice and hummus. 

There were 13 of us there, and it wasn't very busy, so there was plenty of room for us to sit and enjoy. 

It was a little odd having our server help us and the people in the convenient store, but by the time we left, I felt like we had found a nice little gem in New Orleans.  Very unexpected and pleasantly perfect.  You must try it!!",1
1747474,3,"My husband and I came here for a little date night. This time was NOT a good experience. I registered online, was given a time to arrive then when we arrived was told we would have to wait another 40-50 minutes. We were seated in 30 minutes. The waitress took her time getting to our table for drink orders and promptly brought the wrong kind of soda. She then made excuses, which were unnecessary. Everyone makes mistakes. However, when we received our meals, both steaks were cooked wrong. Again, she made excuses and told us she entered the order correctly. Fine, no biggie. She took them back. Here is where it gets really bad....I was brought the same piece of meat ( I had cut it) that had been cooked a bit longer and was now burned on the outside and well done on the inside. I ordered medium. One of the managers brought it back, I told them it was overcooked and I would just have chicken! I was nice about it. I understand that she didn't cook the meal. She was super nice about it and comped my meal and our appetizer. She brought me Alice Springs Chicken, which was very good!! The prompt customer service gets two stars and the chicken meal earned the third. I just feel that a steakhouse should be able to make a good steak. The macaroni and cheese was also amazing, I recommend it as a side dish. It was very cheesy and had a very smoky, savoury flavor.  The overall issue was everyone from the hosts to the managers could be heard making excuses from why the seating was getting messed up to why the meals were getting messed up. It was not a pleasant or relaxing experience.  I don't think we will plan a meal here again but I also don't think I will avoid it. I will just order chicken next time.",1

Great food, great service, great bang for your buck.

Food:
-Hummus appetizer, excellent as usual.  Comes with unlimited fresh baked pita bread, really fluffy and warm and euphoria-inducing.   Imagined myself as a little fluffy sheep jumping over giant fluffy pita bread clouds.  Also took advantage of the whole ""unlimited"" part and got at least 4 bread baskets.
-Chicken Shawarma sandwich, perfectly baked thin pita bread wrapped around warm perfect mix of ingredients, tasty
-Chocolate baklava (ask for warmed), yeahhh release my happy serotonin
-Fruit cocktail smoothie, fruity, not overly sugary, refreshing.  Jizz... as usual

Friends also ordered the Hashwash and Beef shawarma entree.  They seemed to really enjoy their orders as well.
My Persian friend came up with a really crafty idea: cut open the the seam on the fluffy appetizer pita bread to make a pita bread pocket, stuff your entree in the bread pocket.  Blew, my, food-comatose, mind.

Setting:
-Clean, casual, cozy, and well-lit

Service:
-Quick and friendly
-Kudos to our unofficial breadman for diligently replenishing our supply of free pita bread
-More kudos to our server David for being on top of his game and awesome in general.  I might not have the same patience with our table full of ADHD-inflicted big toddlers.

561446,4,"Pho Street is a place I have passed by many times on my way to Trader Joe's but only stopped in recently on a Wednesday night. The pho here is reasonably priced at $11 for a huge bowl (including tax) and is pretty tasty. I have only been to other one Pho place in Philly, so not much comparison, but I was satisfied at both places so I think Pho Street is a good option if you are looking for some Vietnamese. 

They also over spring rolls, rice bowls, and a few other food options if Pho isn't your thing! The ordering process in here is also easy - they have touch pads you can see when you walk in near the back. Just order, pay, and wait for your number to be called. I should note the machines are CC only, so if you want to pay with cash you have to order at the register, under the sign. When you are done, just put your tray on the racks near the trashcan. There is really limited/no interaction with the staff here so if that's your vibe this place is for you!! 

The atmosphere is very casual -  pop music fills the restaurant and the music video of the song plays on one of the TVS. Not much decoration but I didn't mind - this is more of a fast casual kind of place so expectations weren't high there. 

I would definitely come to Pho Street again",1

This is how good things happen by accident........ and it was so!!

Amy was my server and was vegan friendly and highly knowledgable on all the menu items, preparation, food sourcing and I almost asked her to pull up a chair and go on and one!!!  But she was busy with doing the same excellent service for multiple tables.   Never stopped moving!! Awesome service! Water never empty, checking all the time every time she passed.  

Got a non alchoholic beer - Einbecker that I  never heard of and it was very good. 

Then the Quinoa Sweet Potato Fritters for $10 that was tasty had a nice sauce.

For my entree I went with Vegan Ceviche - mushrooms, beans & cucumber marinated in lime caju and passionfruit juice ajii limo (red chili) ajii amarillo ( yellow corn), red onion, choclo (giant corn) , sweet potato, avocado and cancha (crunchy corn)  $13 !!!!   This was really fresh, and a fantastic combination of vegetables, textures, and flavors.  

I am not a dessert guy but Amy was too pursuasive.  I got a carribian banana cake that was worth every calories and was sensational!! It was delicious and I got it warmed.  Superb. 

I give very very few 5 stars and save them  for the ultimate dining place and foods.  This is a 4.5 place for sure (as the average of hundreds report)

The only downside was the valet when we arrived. I realize he's not actually a hotel employee but he does represent them as he's the first person most people have contact with. The valet was incredibly rude to the point that he was screaming at other hotel customers. First time in my life that I stiffed a valet on a tip.

However, this location is seldom as crowded as many of the other locations. Because of this (I'm just guessing) it's also not as hot. It might not be as hot because there are woods around it instead of concrete (who cares, right?). It's never been dirty and when I leave I've seen them mopping under the spin bikes and sanitizing stuff. I usually go here between 6:30 and 9. The thing that really sets this location apart from the others is that they have FANS in the aerobics room and the spin studio. It makes such a difference! I've never had any problems in the parking lot. The other cardio class instructors are fun and will give you a pretty good workout. If you like to follow up your workout with a shopping trip, there's a Super Target nearby. There's also a Starbucks next door if you'd like to negate your calorie deficit. Once, there was a woman in a black velvet leotard and green witch-skin-colored tights that came to a zumba class.

I will knock their phone etiquette also. Once we tried to call in a pickup order 30 minutes before closing time and the person who answered the phone said, ""thanks for calling Big Shakes, we're closed"" and immediately hung up. That was rude.

I have been in at least three times since they opened.  The first times I was there they had a limited menu and a fantastic looking salad bar.  Well due to covid...there is no salad bar...but they sure have pumped up the menu selections in response.  Lots of good looking salads and bowls.  Burgers and sandwiches.  

The food came out pretty quickly and the Southwest Burger my wife ordered was nice and hot when it came out.  Fantastic tasting and filling.  A bit pricey for some...but knowing the quality of the food is the best....I would say it is worth it.

2227364,3,"White Dog is not a place for a gastronomically mind-blowing experience. 

It's a good place for a fancy-ish business lunch where you want to 1) appear like you're taking someone to a fancy restaurant, 2) spend someone else's money because the food is too pricey for its value, and 3) be in good company so you can focus more on talking to your guests than on the mediocre food. 

Don't get me wrong, I love the concept of using locally sourced ingredients and the quaint atmosphere. The service is also pretty decent. But when you're a restaurant, food preparation is kind of a big deal. 

The NY Strip ($32), ordered medium-rare, came out well-done. The cut was too thick, too dry, and chewy. You need an extremely sharp knife to pierce through the rubbery surface of this really tough, unmarinated slab of meat. The butter sauce had no flavor, and the (""crispy""?) onion straws on top were mostly soggy and greasy. 

Brunch here is not too outrageously priced. For $14, I got the Crab and Spinach Benedict, which was good by itself, but the side salad was bitter, chewy (in a tough, hard to fit inside your mouth kind of way), and tossed in a flavorless dressing, accompanied by cold and dry fingerling potatoes.

I've been to other Philly restaurants with a similar concept, but with much better-executed food. Something that stands out at White Dog is that they don't seem to get any of the sauces right. The lack of effort or skill in the way they make the food makes me feel like they are exploiting the idea of supporting local farmers to sell over-priced food to a well-intentioned community.

Also, the restrooms here make me feel glad that I'm on the petite side. They may not be as forgiving to less miniature people. Dining room space is the same. Even I had to carefully wiggle into my seat. 

Overall, the food here gives off an amateurish vibe, and the experience is just extremely OK.",1

Once I was acknowledged I paid for my food and left. 
I ordered the hibachi chicken and Shrimp along with noodles and rice. My mini and I split it and given it was fairly good size portions for a lunch plate. I truly never can decide between the noodles and the rice because they both are so delicious. We also received clear soup and salad with our meal.

The better half and I had tried to go before, but it was just after it had opened. Unfortunately for me the place is in a strip mall where the old Hostess distribution center used to be until 2011. This means that parking is very much at a premium and they have ""Free"" Valet parking. I always feel like ""Free"" Valet parking really just means ""Wink wink, nudge nudge pay us anyway"" so I never use it.

Since we went on a Thursday and the initial demand has diminished enough that parking was not a problem. 

I'm not sure if they literally don't have Diet Coke, but Diet Coke is not on the Menu.  Mexican Bottled Coke is on the menu, but I didn't want that. I fully admit I didn't ask if they had Diet Coke. i was worried that I might be shunned if I asked such a silly question.

I ordered the Classic with the Beef Fat Fries. I don't know if the Beef Fat Fries are really any different from ""Fries"" but they were good. The Burger was also good.  I can't say it was exceptional or awesome but it was good.

Finally I ordered a Turtle Shake to go. This shake was RICH. It was good, but I might say it was slightly TOO sweet. I'm not someone who often says that either.  The one interesting thing though is they use Liquid Nitrogen with the shakes, so they come out smoking. I'm not entirely sure what the benefit of this is, if there is one, but it's a cool effect and it is cold. Though it warms up at a normal rate.

Overall I'd come back, but I wouldn't use the ""Free"" valet if the lot was full.",1

5195093,5,This restaurant is 30 miles away from my house and I go there every weekend for their mutton biryani. That's how much I love their food. I have tried hyderabadi biryani in around 20 + Indian restaurant in Tampa Bay area and this is undoubtedly the best.,1

145508,5,"Ole Ole Ole Ole and just one more Ole ! 
This place is the real deal and then some. After missing our original movie time CB and i were famished and in need of a place that was open for lunch and close to /in Nolibs. After a combination of yelping and groupon nowing we decided on Las Cazuelas. We walked in and the place was empty as in the kitchen staff , hostess and waitress were all standing around not usually a good sign but we went with it. After seating us at a table the hostess/waitress offered up bevs since we did not want to imbibe before the film we went with mexican sodas pina for me and orange for CB. Chips and salsa arrived at the table and the salsa had a surprising sweet flavor but it was cold (weird) but still tasty. We started with the fundidio which comes with your choice of mushrooms, chorizo or poblano peppers. We opted for the peppers. The fundido was perfect the peppers added a little kick and the cheese was stringy greasy perfection. My only gripe was we only got 3 flour tortillas so its a good thing we still had plenty of chips left or all that fundido would have been wasted. I couldn't decide if i wanted 2 or 3 tacos and at 2.75 each ( A STEAL ) i got 3 shrimp tacos authentic w/ cilantro and onions. I expected nothing like what i received. 3 huge shrimp tacos each holding 3 GIANT shrimp and just a sprinkling of onions the perfect ratio. the shrimp were cooked amazingly well and were seasoned with a slight spice YUM. CB tried each of the chicken taco options and one shrimp he enjoyed them all very much. Since they offered dessert and I'm a sucker for sweet things we split the tres leches cake which was very moist and creamy. I wrapped up my lunch with a mexican coffee hot and sweet with just a little punch. Our service was great and towards the end of lunch more tables arrived.
This restaurant is a little on the small side (downstairs has less than 6 tables I'm sure it would be great for groups though) Id say come here for a start to your friday night since its a BYOT and a BYOB . The menu is very reasonable and the parking situation is pretty awesome . I will def be back i think i found my Philly Mexican GO TO SPOT",1

The staff is nice and helpful and I'm blown away by how much they're doing to accommodate COVID best practices. Arrows throughout the store, controlling number of people in the store as well as popular areas such as shoes.

This location is quite small for an REI, but has a small bit of most things you'd look for at REI...to clarify the things I've looked for are hydroflasks, clothing, shoes, bike gear, endurance nutrition....so just note it's a smaller location and if you want things outside those, the staff is very helpful with guiding you to online and helping you out.",1

I love this location because of how easy you can move around. They have display cases (which could be a little higher off the ground) circling the room, as well as wall displays circling the entire room. At rarely is in the middle which I enjoy looking at while my fiancé shops around. 
I really enjoy looking at their water accessories and the display case in the middle. They have local glass pieces for sale, by local artists :) 
Everyone is so nice. Sometimes hard to get someone's attention but once you have it they help you until your transaction is finished. They always have what I'm looking for and then some. I bought new incense: Harlequin and Carnival. This is the only place I've been able to find these new scents. I happened to walk by and the Carnival had me instantly. I just HAD to smell it out lol. Their display cases always look more appealing too because of how bright they are. Other head shops I've been to they line their cases with black velvet. Which is cool so you can see through the glass, but  it honestly doesn't help. That's why I like how 20 Past has velvet pads you can sit the glass on.",1
219841,5,"Best roll I think I ever had. So I am speaking of Liscio's wholesale baked goods as I have never ventured into Glassboro or anywhere in area. 

I was on vacation near LBI and discovered Liscio's bread products at my local ACME in Barnegat. I am very picky about my bread, I don't eat a lot of bread but I will indulge when it is very good and with good butter on hand. So as soon as I spotted the delightful SNOWFLAKE ROLL in the bakery case with all that cute powdered flour on top of a lovely bouncy poofy roll, I knew this would be good. 
I came home sliced in half and buttered it up, put in micro for 10 seconds and voila. Best roll I ever had in my life and I lived in France:)  It was all about texture and melt in your mouth goodness. 

I will be now hunting for wholesale Liscio products from now on in this area. I hope they do very well. 

thank you for my NJ bread fix, back to ""death of bread-ville"" aka Washington DC tomorrow",1

5650175,5,I stopped here while on vacation in Clearwater. I was pretty disappointed by the seafood near the beach because everything seemed to be way overpriced and not good quality. It is so worth it to go a little out of your way to this restaurant because the value is amazing and it's the best tasting food in the entire area. The crawfish boils are fantastic and I also got a side of fried okra which was great. They have such a long line that you're best off ordering ahead of time over the phone. They are also a great option for take-out.,1

We ordered their fried green tomatoes, flatbreads, gnocchi, bib salad and spinach salad. My friend substituted adding chicken to the salad option and our server was very knowledgeable. We asked for recommendations for the meal and she did not disappoint. We enjoyed sparkling water with our meal for the table. The first thing I noticed upon entering the restaurant was the smell. There is an aroma of bacon and hickory, and it is a lovely mixture. The decor and ambiance of the establishment is lovely and impressive. The most important feature of the restaurant would be their operating practices. Their food is sourced from local Florida farmers! Additionally, they have a garden and herb garden on the premises. This is a lovely, sustainable idea that I support. The food was delicious and had layers to the taste. I will be coming back and bringing more friends and family to enjoy.",1

No, wait, never mind.,.that's going to limit my time choices with him.. schedule with someone else!! I as a Karen, need my schedule choices!!!!!!! 

Jeremy is new to this location, but not new to hairstyling. In fact, he has trained more stylists probably than I have changed my shoes! 

Just as with the other JJoesph location, you walk in and instantly know it will be a relaxing time- the high end, but comfortable decor welcomes you. But never snobby, snooty nonsense you feel in other salons-really down to earth peeps here. Products always available but never hard pushy sales.

In no covid times an offer or wine, coffee or water. (I am still recommending an espresso machine...hint hint, oh and a jar full of Oreos) Covid, you are greeted at the door, mask on, covid screen then a temp check- above and beyond to make their guests feel safe.

I brought a few pics, here's is what I am thinking...will it work? Will that color make my skin glow or look washed out. Honest answers and guidance- if it'll look good they will tell you! Same goes for special occasion up do's. I have watched stylists work intensity to give options ideas.. If your idea can't be done today, they will tell you why (usually your hair can't do that...yet..but here is the plan) and then the  mixology magic customized to make you feel amazing as you leave. I love to show a pic, then that is the last decision I need to make! I hate decisions with my hair and nails!

First off these cheese steaks are huge!!!  So you may want to consider sharing one especially if you plan to get a few sides to go along with it. We both got ""the block"" which comes with mushrooms, onions, green or sweet peppers and provolone cheese ( or you can choose another type of cheese). These were excellent subs with just the right portion of add ins to meat. We also got a small order of waffle fries with cheese wiz and onion rings which are very generous portions. Loved the waffle fries, but eat them before the cheese cools down for the best taste. The onion rings were good but nothing special, but they were very fresh and hot.  They have an excellent bottle beer collection with plenty of craft choices. We were there about 9pm on a Friday night so not crowed and the service was enthusiastic and very friendly (coming from NYC, that's always a refreshing plus).",1

Although renovated several years ago, the building still retains a vintage charm, with floor to ceiling windows that allow light to flood the comfortable reading area.  A Hot Reads section gives me the opportunity to pick up one of the current best sellers while the library's consortium membership enables me to borrow books from other institutions.

The books on CD selection could be more extensive---but I'm still working my way through the titles.  The library offers a variety of services, including passport assistance, which is very handy. Some of the librarians are smiley and some are a little cranky---but for some crazy reason, that little bit o' crankiness seems okay.",1

1838763,5,"Okay road warriers take note of this!  This is the restaurant in the Four Points by Sheraton at the Tucson Airport - not normally expected to be a culinary hot spot.  Wrong in this case!  The amazing (yet simple) menu selections are something I've NEVER seen at a Four Points property, anywhere.  It helps that the place actually has an Executive Chef (indeed!), who honed his craft at resorts in Scottsdale.  

I was trying to go light because it was late, so I chose the dinner Caesar Salad with Scallop option - totally violating my normal rule of ""no seafood more than 300 miles from the coastline"", because I was totally intrigued that someone would even attempt to put this on the bill-of-fare.  Let me tell you, that dish is why I am writing this review the same evening.  The large salad included 3 large scallops (not puny bay scallops) - PERFECTLY done (seasoned and seared with a crust - yet fleshy and lightly cooked in the middle)  something I don't often see, even in fine seafood establishments who supposedly know what they are doing with this touchy ingredient.  It was worth every penny of the $8 upgrade to the plain Caesar Salad ($20 total)!

But wait...there's more! - Federal Contractors and Employees take note!!!  The FedRate room contract at this hotel includes a $15.00 Food and Beverage Voucher for the R&R Bar and Grill!!! (yes $15, not 15%).  I almost felt like I was taking advantage of the place.   So I spent a bit more and got dessert - A chef's choice artisan cheese platter (not much sugar there!) which was excellent as well (see picture).  Don't know if this is a short term promotion, or part of the rate for this year, but it is indeed an amazing bargain.

The staff was somewhat thin because of the late hour, but they were attentive, very pleasant, and the service was excellent!

I am coming back to try some of the other offerings.  I'm also staying at this hotel in the future because the entire place is of resort quality, not an airport 'box' hotel.

If you're staying in the airport hotel area at Tucson Intl. Airport....or you live close by...it's worth coming in for a meal!",1

Not only is the staff super friendly and knowledgeable; the office is very clean and has the newer technology you want when you go to the dentist. You have your temperature checked upon entry and a short online questionnaire to complete prior to the office visit.

It was the perfect haven for a rainy afternoon and it's since become my favorite spot for a late-Sunday lunch and drink to finish off the weekend.
Each time I've had a different server and have found each of them to be courteous, pleasant and knowledgable about their menu selections. They were happy to give me drink pairing suggestions when I asked for one, and to recommend dessert (you have never had bread pudding until you've had it at the Caribou Cafe!)
The first time I went, there was a jazz duo playing and they drew in customer and onlookers. A great addition to the overall experience. Some menu favorites are the salade d'endive, salade de chèvre, croque poulet provencal, moules frites... bread pudding, crème brûlée, and fruit melba crêpes. I have yet to try their prix fixe lunch and dinner menus, but look forward to trying even more menu items. The beer selection is somewhat limited and pricey, and I'm not a wine drinker so this isn't a place I go to try new beers.
The decor is lovely - big, bright vintage French advertisements, polished woodwork and ornate lighting. It's a very pleasant place during ""off-peak"" hours since the atmosphere and menu encourage a leisurely pace... reminiscent of someplace less American and more - oh, I don't know - French, perhaps? ;) If you're a jazz fan, find out when they're playing next and go have yourself a merry little escargot.",1

BOB has a very VERY cool outdoor area that makes room for Bocci ball and cornhole, lots of TV's and plenty of seating. The indoor seating area was also incredible and you can tell they put a ton of work into making this a really special place. I probably would have taken away two stars for the food but this place is still new so I expect there to be some sticking points. I ordered the breaded tenderloin which was breaded and cooked well, but it wasn't served with mayo and was lacking in flavor. This Hoosier staple should always be served with Mayo as far as I'm concerned and adding a small amount seasonings goes a long way. A friend I was with ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the shredded pork was very cold. The service was great and our server was very pleasant.

Waitperson was very nice. He welcomed us and asked if it was INSIDE or OUTSIDE we were choosing tonight. Well, they do have a delightful shade outside in the late afternoon, but we chose inside because my hubs likes the tunes that were playing and it was very cozy. 
Simple fare... the UNION and the GODFATHER... we were going to share, but we were both particularly hungry. We did give each other a half  of the sandwich to enjoy the taste sensations to be experienced. They did a good job. Sandwiches were tasty, and fries edible. I like mine with a lil Ranch.

My poor dog had kennel cough recently and they were so accommodating and got her in the same day so they could see her and give us meds to go home with to get her feeling better quickly. They have great customer service and are so very nice. The doctors really listen to your concerns, and don't hurry you at all. Wether it's her annual check up or other things that come up they always are great. This place is super clean and very welcoming and my dog always feels comfortable here.

If you are looking to be pampered and waited on hand and foot, go to Burns in Tampa (which is also awesome, but for different reasons). Otherwise, the Brass Monkey is a great place to sit on the patio, watch an awesome sunset and eat a burger and fries when you have had enough seafood on your trip to the beach. We make a point to go here every time we visit and will be back next week. I say go and try it for yourself. \",1

2824791,5,This place is a really good priced car wash. I spent $23 for a full hand wash and vacuum of the inside. I have an suv and in some places I've been to its at least $30-40 for something like that. The guys there were very professional. Highly recommend. Only bad thing is that this place gets busy which is a testament to how many people love them and keep coming back,1
3993021,3,"I would have given this place more stars if it wasn't for the waitress:( First, the outside is super cute. I saw it while driving by and had to give it a try. It's an adorable little corner diner decked out in cute Christmas decor. The inside is quaint and relaxing. 

Upon arrival, you're welcome to sit yourself. We chose the booth by the front door and had no problem finding a spot. The waitress greeted us pretty promptly, just after finishing her conversation about how much weight she recently lost. She was less enthusiastic about taking out order than she was about raving about her recent diet, but whatever. We order a pizza to split, and some simple garlic knot appetizers. 

I have to start by saying one of my biggest pet peeve's while eating out, is when the appetizer is not delivered when an appetizer should be, i.e., prior to the entree. Hence the word, appetizer. Unfortunately, the appetizer was not even brought out before, nor during our main course. I knew she must have forgotten about it, so we asked her after we received our pizza and, in her typical lackluster fashion, she slumped to the kitchen to retrieve them....or did she? We were half way through our pizza before they came, and when they did, she dumped them on our table and walked off. Hmm....no ""hey sorry about that,"" or ""it's my fault, I totally forgot."" No, nothing. 

Here comes the part we knew we were working up to during our session of lethargic service....the check. The moment that should take 2 minutes but ends up taking 20. Our waitress is like Halley's Comet. I saw her once in my life and didn't think she'd be back around until my children's generation. Yet, like a beacon of light, she is spotted. She tends to the table across from us, then she maneuvers to the table just in front of us, yes....she's getting closer, closer to use being able to get out of here...but she stops short of our table and quickly retreats back to the kitchen...drat! 

I charge her with my credit card like a lion hunting a Zebra on the Savannah. She is cornered, like a deer in headlights. I move in for the kill, ""Excuse me, I'm sorry, but we're in a hurry and need to go. Please run the card."" I then strut back to our table with the utmost authority. Success! The card is charged and we are free! 

Oh, and to get back to reality for a second, I found the pizza to be good, the garlic knots just ok, and the price to be great. My fiance is a native New Yorker which automatically make him a pizza connoisseur, found the pizza beneath him as he does most places not centrally located in lower Manhattan. But I would say if you can avoid the waitress a la attitude, you will be pleased with the pizza and the price.",1
1559904,5,I stopped by here on my morning run today. i only ran around for a couple minutes but its a well shaded park with lots of trees. Theres a pavilion and a restroom that i also saw. i didn't get to the rest of the park but i came across a 250 year old oak tree!,1
5785442,4,"Best Mexican food ever!

I've never thought that Mexican food was so good until I went to Los Agaves. First, I was a little surprised at the almost self-service style -- you have to order at the counter and pay first, then wait to be seated with a number plate. It was Saturday night, so they were very busy and we waited about 20 minutes to get seats. We had the Earth and Sea Molcajete, which many people mentioned on Yelp, and the Los Agaves burrito. They were very delicious with big shrimps and tender halibut. I used to think that Mexican food was smelly, but the dishes we had here was presented beautifully and smelled great! The quality of food is pretty good and the price is inexpensive. 

I think I will eat Mexican food more often from now on!",1
1642602,4,"My first visit to Sweet Art was an accident. I was walking from my home in the South Tower Grove neighborhood to visit a friend in Shaw. I was early, so I walked a bit past her street and smelled something heavenly. It was one of the perfect summer days: hot (but not too), cloudless blue sky, people all about their Saturday errands.

I looked in the one plate glass window and the place was packed - at 10 am! Everyone looked so happy. I now know why. Cakes, pastries and food at Sweet Art are like a drug. Once you have a taste, you are hooked. Butter and sugar mixed in the right combination are a stronger drug than heroin - at least here. I ordered a slice of their amazing quiche to go.

I decided then and there that one day I would try a cupcake (especially since my boyfriend is a cupcake fiend). When he visited around Halloween, we decided to ask Sweet Art to make up 2 doz cupcakes for our centerpiece (Halloween-themed of course, with a special birthday one for our friend, Ben). When we arrived to pick them up the evening of the party, we decided to keep the boxes sealed until we got home to build our anticipation. We were thrilled. If the sweet scent of their butter cream frosting was not enough, they had mixed 4 different flavors and designs (Frankensteins, spiders & webs, pumpkins, etc). 

The centerpiece was much loved and a huge, delicious success. I had to send our friends home with any remaining cupcakes so we would not eat the rest and blow our ""healthy living"" program. And, had we kept them, I seriously thought it might end in violence when we got to the last cupcake. Better to heave that kind of responsibility on others and keep the peace at home.

Sweet Art is a treasure and I hope they enjoy the sweetness of their success for many years. Now, stop reading this and go get a cupcake!

(My only negative about them is their drip coffee, but they are a bakery not a coffee house. Firstly, I am not impressed by Goshen to begin with, and it doesn't seem to have much flavor or oomph! at $2 a cup. They should partner with Kaldi's. That's just my two cents.)",1

3142515,3,"I do enjoy the food at Wasabi, but the owner is lacking in tact and professionalism. My husband went to meet friends there one night, so we requested a table for 4. The other couple were waiting on got stuck in some very heavy traffic so they decided turn back and told us to eat without them. We enjoyed a few rolls and some edamame before finishing up and heading out. The owner ran out after us when we were in our car and started yelling and asking where we thought we were going. We told her we were leaving and she yelled some more about how we tried to not pay. My husband told her we paid and were leaving, and she was mad because she thought we were dining and dashing since the other couple never showed and we ate without them. She did not apologize or feel embarrassed about her wrongful accusations, and just stomped back inside.  She is an unfriendly, stingy and uptight woman, and she has made our experience unpleasant more than once. Typically, we just order our food to go if we are in the mood for sushi to try to avoid most of her unpleasantness. 

The asparagus tempura roll is great, I also recommend trying some of their other basics like the Philly.",1

1384473,5,"This is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. Here's the reason why:

Although I'm a foodie that loves to try everything and I don't worry too much about calories, I buy organic and try to eat as healthy as possible on the regular...this way I can indulge when I go out to eat and not feel so guilty. 

Well, Fresh Bites allows me both. Natural ingredients along with great flavor! I love Lebanese food, so to get it organic is a huge bonus.

The meats are all so tasty. I'm on a mission to have every dish on the menu...everything is good. The salad covers most of your plate, as it should. You get a perfect amount of meat and veggies. The rice is quite fragrant...I'm not certain, but I think it's made with coconut milk. 

My only complaint is that they run out of Labneh (a Mediterranean yogurt with olive oil). I love this stuff. I can slather it all over my lamb meat, it's so good...actually I go back and forth between hummus and labneh. :) Oh, they make good, fresh hummus too.

So, I've never been crazy about baklava...until I had it at Fresh Bites. I guess it's because I've never had baklava so good. The filo is so crispy, the pistachio is so crunchy and the honey is so perfectly sweet.

The owners make you feel welcome and are dedicated to good quality and take pride in their food. The baklava wasn't made to their standards one day, so they still served it to me, but wouldn't charge me for it. You just don't get that type of service everywhere.

The place is quaint and fills up fast with just a few families. I recommend going on weeknights. We went on a Friday night once and were lucky to get a table.",1

6833554,5,"Off the charts.  

Pizza is top notch, only to face competition from a couple of elite pizza spots I have hit in Queens and the Lower East Side.  Perfect thin crust and great sauce make the pie - I almost feel bad ordering anything other than the Classic.  But then, they have great pepperoni, the steak and hot pepper, and some other creative pies that are delicious.  If you are a pizza connoisseur, this is a must try.

Beer wall - maybe 16 taps of craft beer and 4 taps of wine.  I repeat, beer wall.  Until you've gotten to try a wall of craft beer at your own pace, you may not fully appreciate the value.  Choose your beer, pour however much you want utilizing your best college-learned keg technique, drink, repeat.  

Vince's is the best.",1
3598046,4,"Im moving and needed to get rid of some things...I didnt really know what to expect because I have never tried to sell any of my possessions before-usually I just donate-but this time I had some pricer clothing items that were rarely worn that I wanted to see if I could get some money for it before just donating.

The owner and the 2 staff members were really friendly and told me that the wait was about 25 minutes to get my things evaluated. I saw on the sheet I signed that all clothes not picked up within 24 hours are donated, which seems fair to me. I didn't mind the wait and the shop was pretty lively, with 5-10 customers in at a time. 

Closet exchange ended up buying 90% of the garments/shoes that I brought, and on the racks I found 2 J crew men dress shirts that costed me $22 total (with 10% off for using the money I had just made off them). I took home $30 cash which I am pleased about.

For those interested in selling their items-they take in season, lightly or unworn clothing, purchased within the last 2 years. They do sell designer brands and handbags, as well as ""mall brands"" like BR, GAP, American Eagle, Express etc.",1

2190558,4,"This place is so cool.

I want to preface this review with I did not eat anything while here. The pizza is Chipotle style where you pick what you want and they bake it super quickly for you in a big giant oven. The food I saw looked delicious but didn't look like anything groundbreaking.

What WAS groundbreaking was allllllll the beer taps they had available to the customers. When you walk in you can see an entire wall of taps ready for consumption. All you have to do is go to the register, give them your card and get a bracelet. Holding the bracelet up to the beer tap allows you to choose whatever beer you want and fill up!

The beer is metered and however much you pour is how much you end up paying for. This is great because if you just want to try something, you can pour a teeny bit and just pay a teeny bit. If it sucks, you can proceed to the next tap and if it's good, you can go for it.

All places should have this beer tap functionality. It's incredible, and if you're in this area of Nashville, STOP HERE.",1
130908,3,"Yet ANOTHER frozen yogurt shop in CC Philly - like we don't have enough, already! But Berry Sweet has a special place in my heart (despite the eh froyo - consistency varies, flavors are fine, generic ones that don't quite taste natural even for fruity flavors that should - it's like the majority of the froyo places in CC, including the price per ounce). 

This place is super popular with families, including my fiance's now 4 year old cousin. Its right near Seger Park Playground, and warmer weather means that more and more families, after running around the (new!) playground, walk over together for a treat the whole family can enjoy. Grocery shoppers will also stop by, either before or after a shopping trip, so be prepared to share space with the little ones, parents, and caregivers - all on a sugar high :)",1

4953530,3,"*Current resident*

I moved to Philly from out of state and wasn't able to come out ahead of time to find an apartment, so I had to search on a time crunch. By the time I saw PTP, I was desperate for a place to live that wasn't going to cost a fortune. At the time, my little studio was under $1,000 per month and the area was great, so I moved in. 
I have a love/hate relationship with this place. The pool is amazing, and when they aren't shutting the parkway down for some concert or marathon, the area is really nice. I have noticed an improvement since new management took over, but it is almost impossible to get someone to answer the phone when you need something. I appreciate the shuttle to Center City, but I wish they had a way for you to track where it is on the route; the driver loves to either be 10 minutes early or late, and I've stood around waiting for 45 minutes because he already came and went and I missed it. I've had the occaisional pest problem, and I've had to submit plenty of maintenance requests for appliances. Usually someone comes within a day of my online request, and overall I'm satisfied with the work they do. 
A note on the construction: MAJOR PAIN. The electricity and water are shut off about once a week, and they closed the community laundry room. We still have one set of machines on each floor of the building, but they are more expensive and they don't get my clothes clean. I've had to start driving to a laundromat. From what I've seen of the renovations they are doing, the new apartments will be very nice, but many of the current residents will not be able to afford to continue living here. 
I've heard horror stories from people on their move-out experience and I'm worried about going through it myself in a few months when I leave. I'll try to update with my experience.",1

My last couple of visits have been to get a flat rate USPS box, which is free to pick up by any customer. So, since they provide that service, I like to actually buy something to reimburse them for the time they spent lifting a heavy (sarcasm) empty box. Each and every time, they try to charge me for the box. You don't pay for the box until you go to ship, even at a Post Office.

5807156,5,"Set in a residential area, this converted house to restaurant screams decor straight from Clue the board game. The entrance contains a velvet seated throne and large pictures of seemingly important individuals who at one time probably made killer steaks or were famous winos.  Either way, they are important staples to the experience at Bern's. Oddly enough, the food was good up to the steak which was sub-par. The meat quality was decent although probably not as aged as some other steak houses, and the flavor was a little dull.

So why the 5 stars? Bern's is an eating experience to behold. From the rich and somewhat strange decor,  to the after dinner kitchen/wine cellar tour (if it's your first time, you have to do it!) to the dessert seating upstairs, it's a 5 star knock-out if you want to impress a date or even your snobby, rich, multiple marriage, amateur wine connoisseur of an uncle. They have an amazing wine collection which is documented in a book that is thicker than your average chemistry book and it houses one of the largest private collections of wine in the world. Also, after dinner, there is an exclusive dessert eating area with private booths equipped with old-fashioned looking music selectors. You essentially press a button and that type of music plays from your booth.

What to get? Macadamian nut ice cream. Holy crap. It's like Donald Trump made this thing. ""My ice cream is the best in the world. I hand made this ice cream with my bare hands. I imported the finest Parisian chocolate and added my special blend of hand picked macadamian nuts, and you're fired!""

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",1

Tom was our driver and Vicky was our guide. They were both very entertaining! We enjoyed seeing the sites while she told us a few facts and jokes about them. The boat ride was different. Never been on a bus that transforms into a boat so that was cool. Too bad there was no ac during the whole ride. That would've made it perfect.",1
237470,4,"4.5 stars - No need for a hardware big box stores in the city center when you have excellent local hardware stores like this. 

Whenever I need something hardware related I always come here. Staff are friendly and very efficient. As soon as you walk in the store you are greeted and asked what you need. 

The staff are very knowledgeable and willing to offer advice to help you get your job done. I've been here for screws, broken toilets, paint, furnace filters, caulking and many other random needs. Prices are very reasonable as well. 

Highly recommended.

We ordered the pot stickers for an app to share; it was excellent!

Two house salads, nicely done, fresh and included bread.

It had all the right favors and the amount of sauce they give you is just right.

The coconut pudding is also a great way to end the meal; it wasn't too sweet and was equally as delicious. 

Just keep an eye on the tablet that what you want is actually keyed in. We ordered the spring rolls and they did not make it onto the ticket. Other than that every thing is great!",1

859145,4,The burger is really excellently prepared and seasoned. The bun leaves something to be desired. I got the peanut butter burger and the first few bites are awesome but I think the peanut butter flavor gets a bit too overwhelming by bite 6.

5944697,3,"I had wanted to try this place for a while.  I took two customers and a colleague for lunch.  The hostess that sat us wasn't super welcoming.  The server took our order and I guess I was expecting a little explanation about the concept.  Finally I asked expecting to get a full explanation about the chef experimenting with different cooking techniques like using nitrogen or lasers or something but was left underwhelmed by her explanation and a little insulted by her expression as I posed the question. 

As far as the food goes, I ordered the Jamaican chicken and waffles which was good but not great.  Datz's Waffles n Tweet is the high water mark.  This was a few notches below. I had expected a spicy jerk flavoring on the chicken. None.  

Drinks were served in beakers and water was poured from other lab equipment.  I thought that added to the experience and was cool.  I guess I wanted more of a ""show"" about the techniques.  I wanted to see beakers bubbling over or see the chef in a lab coat.  

In a crowded food scene like South Tampa you have to stand out. The food was good but not great and that was the consensus around the table.

The variety and quality of gear you can purchase here is excellent.  Further, they truly do honor their lifetime, money back guarantee for anything you buy from them.  My wife had a pair of snowboard boots that weren't wearing properly and we returned them after using them for a few months.

3072202,4,"There is no way I could visit the South and not have BBQ.  I searched Yelp and found this listed as a 4 Star restaurant.

When I arrived, I was pleased to see that they had an option for small or large sandwiches.  This allowed me to try more than 1.

Food - I had a small Sliced BBQ Beef and a small BBQ Pork sandwich.  Both sandwiches came with 1 Hush Puppy and a mustard cole slaw for spreading on the sandwich.  I ordered some fries as well.

The flavor of the pork sandwich was very good.  I was pleased to see that the meat wasn't doused in BBQ sauce.  I hate it when places do that.  They give you a bottle of their house BBQ sauce with your order so that you can add it to your meal as you see fit.  It had a nice smoky flavor.  The size of the sandwich was perfect....approx 4-5 oz of meat on a med sized bun.  The mustard cole slaw was an awesome touch to the sandwich.

The flavor of the Sliced BBQ Beef sandwich was just as good.  There was no BBQ sauce at all on the sandwich and was slightly dry...which is how I like it.   Again, the mustard cole slaw was a great add-on to the flavor.  I added a little of the house BBQ sauce to both sandwiches.  

The only thing was I wish there was a spicier option for the sauce.  I like BBQ sauce with bite.  There were bottles of tabasco and peppers on the table....but I think a BBQ restaurant should have a spicy house sauce.

The fries were fresh cut steak fries.  They were fried just right...not too soggy and not too crispy.  Good level of salt added too.  They get an A+ here.  The same for the Hush Puppies...they were fried just right.  I hate when Hush Puppies are over or under cooked.  That wasn't the case here.

Service - The staff there was very friendly.  They asked if that was my first time visiting them and offered a few suggestions.  They were also very friendly to the other patrons in the restaurants, so that was a huge plus in my book.

I gave them 4 Stars....would have given them 5 Stars if they had spicier sauce options.  I also would have liked to see a hot links sandwich....but I understand that you can't find that in all restaurants.

Will I return?  If I have the opportunity to come back to Tampa, absolutely!",1
3712016,3,"Located on State Street downtown so a great location with plenty of foot traffic.  If you want to people watch, you should sit outside.  

Came here for lunch with a group of 4.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant, which kind of had a Mediterranean feel than an Italian feel.  I had the Italian Cobb Panini with grilled chicken, pancetta, gorgonzola cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and avocado with a side of Mista Salad.  It was pretty good, but messy to eat as everything kept falling out.  The garlic cheese bread that they used was too fulfilling for me that for half of it, I ate everything inside and not the bread.  It was kind of like a foccacia.  My husband had the Margherita Pizza.  It was good, but nothing special.

Service was excellent.  I think it was better than the food.  Our server was really personable and friendly.  He told us about the history of the restaurant and told us how they used local ingredients.",1
5844420,5,"BEST BUTTER CHICKEN I HAVE EVER HAD. Sorry that sounded so aggressive but it is truly no exaggeration. It was so creamy, and full of flavour. The chicken was tender and the addition of the basmati rice and green onion was just right. Not to mention the best naan bread I've ever had as well! You could tell it was made just minutes before being served, it was so fresh and warm. They have a lunch size or dinner size portion depending on your hunger level and occasion! Great service as well. They do take out too which is awesome. If you are looking for Indian food make Guru your first choice!",1
2677047,3,"Ah yes, just what Delco needs... another bar and grill.  

So I'll start with a disclaimer or two.  First off, I visited the Drexel Hill Casey's about 4 years ago, and wasn't impressed.  I really didn't want that to influence my review here though.  But admittedly my expectations were low.  Secondly, I'm a bit disappointed because this place replaced Nora Lee's in this space, and I loved Nora Lee's.  I'll say this right up front.  The fact that we lost a New Orleans style restaurant that served great food and gained yet another neighborhood style bar and grill in these parts is a net loss to me.  I'm sorry.  We have too many choices in Delco for this type of atmosphere.  

So what that means is Casey's really has to bring something different to the table to make me want to come here instead of Barnaby's for example.  Casey's, you gotta wow me!

I'll say this... everything in the joint looks new, so they have that going for them.  The upstairs is laid out very well and I could be comfortable up there.  

The downstairs... not so much.  Since I walked in the door by the downstairs bar, I sat right there just because.   I know what they are trying to do.  They built the downstairs area to be more close knit, and more neighborhood bar-like to be separate from the upstairs music atmosphere, which is admirable.  

Problem is, the downstairs bar the way it is built feels more like a bar in someone's basement that is two sizes too big for the space.  Nice try, but cramped.  And really, we have more than enough ""neighborhood bars"" in Delco.  Give me something a little better than that.  

But two things are important, the food and the service.  I'll say that service wise, the bartender who served me, Gail, was as nice as can be.  I enjoyed chatting with her, and she took good care of me.  Give her a raise!

Now the food... my first thought is that I wanted to see something on the menu that caught my eye and set this place apart.  Something to say that ""Hey, we're not the same ol Delco place you've seen a hundred times before!""  

Nope, didn't find that.  Although I am told that they will be having a carving station in the future (and they will have to beat Tom and Jerry's which is an excellent place for a sandwich), nothing jumped at me as a must try dish.  So I asked Gail to recommend something.  She recommended the Reuben sandwich, saying that they were selling a lot of them, and people were calling it the best Reuben they ever had.  OK... sold!

So, for $8.49 I got a decent sized Reuben with homemade chips.  Also, for $5.50 I got a pint of Sam Adams Winter Ale.  By the way... tap beer selection downstairs is somewhat minimal, another disappointment which I hope they expand. 

I won't call it the best Reuben I ever had (New York delis... you can't beat them).  However, judging by the fact that I polished it off, and wanted more of the chips afterward, I felt satisfied.  

I might not make this a destination place.  I don't think I'm telling anyone from out of town that when they come here they gotta try Casey's.  Maybe someday they'll get to that level.  But, if you sit upstairs, and if you like Reuben sandwiches and Sam Adams beer, it's not too bad.  I may come back and try the carving station to give them a shot at wowing me.  

But really, if they're just going to do the same thing that they did in Drexel Hill, well it might work for them.  It just won't work for me.",1

There are many amazing options, but my current biggest crush is the tofu stroganoff. Oh. My. God.

I can't even remember the rest of the awesome stuff on the menu, captivated as I am by this dish, but lots of creative vegetarian--no measly french fries, plain pasta or yawn-worthy salad.

We don't drink so we just had pop and our girls had Italian Soda. 

The restaurant itself is literally a hole in the wall but its simple interior and cozy feeling made it quite a pleasant experience. I especially liked that it was warm - it was really cold outside and I hate when it's cold in a restaurant. 

As this is a small place, make sure you come early. We were sitting at the communal table, there was no room otherwise and right after we got there, a line formed and people waited.

5613019,4,"Stopped in for a quick smoothie and some frozen yogurt. The smoothie was good said the lil one and my chocolate frozen yogurt was delicious. 

Their prices are not bad and their service is great. The young lady was very nice and she was very helpful to my son, who had just had a dental appointment. I just wanted ice cream and it scratched an itch I didn't know was even there. 

The yogurt was so creamy and if I could stir up the energy I would go right back now. The toppings were fresh and covered. Which is a good thing cuz don't nobody want sneezed on M&Ms, nuts or cherries. 

The place is clean and you can tell they pride themselves on taking care of it. 

I give them 4 stars based on their food quality and quality service but their prices are a bit expensive. I spent $9 on a Light sized smoothie and a yogurt with only 2 toppings.",1

My mom and I had the chicken cracklin's and burgers. I got my burger with the Homemade pimento cheese. I highly recommend getting it that way. This was a special burger! They had a good variety of beer available as well as some tasty looking cocktails. I will definitely eat here again while I'm in town!",1

Beware that there is another Freddy & Tony's around the corner on 201 Allegheny but the name is spelled differently. I only know this because after tasting the alcappurrias here (on the way to Cousin's), I wanted to go back and get more. We pulled out the Yelp app which took us to the other place. We were so confused when we pulled up, haha. 

This is on the corner in a not so nice, neighborhood, but food is very inexpensive and delicious. We had a roasted chicken (they were out of pernil), boiled yucca, alcapurrias (4), and arroz con gandules. Everything was delicious! The rice had pork in it, too, which was a bonus. I think everything came out to under $30 and was plenty of food for a family of four. We have picked up take-out several times since. 

They are cash only, so be prepared!",1
4963194,3,"My wife and I spent the Memorial day weekend at the 4 Seasons where Cielo has the space off of their lobby. We went for breakfast and dinner. 

Dinner. Pretty solid. We split an Heirloom Beet salad that was very good. I had homemade Tagliatelle with Bison Ragu and Parmegiano Reggiano, my wife had the Halibut with Fava Beans. My wife loved her fish, but I was expecting a lot more from my pasta. The pasta was fresh, but I was expecting a nice chunky ragu and there was little meat to be found. The cheese was also some brittle thingy that did nothing for the dish and had me asking the waiter for the freshly grated cheese I longed for. We had a chocolate and nutella crepe, which was pretty good as well. 

For breakfast we sat out on the beautiful patio overlooking the pool and Arch. We both had the Omelette with Spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes. Very tasty and light. 

As for service... 

Hello, you are at the 4 seasons and it just does not get any better. As for dinner, we had better and frankly I was expecting more. I would go back to Pi or Niche first.",1

827536,3,"We made reservations 6 weeks ahead of time and were excited to try yet another Starr restaurant. After waiting for 30 minutes the hostess informed us that she wouldn't be seating us at a booth. She indicated that they planned to use them to seat larger parties unless we wanted to wait until 10:30pm. Our reservations were set for 8:30pm, so this was not an option. After we sat, we then watched the hostess seat multiple couples in larger tables, including one right in front of us. This was very disappointing.

We had a phenomenal server named Zack. We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, which we were told were new to the menu. For the first time, I actually didn't/couldn't finish something I ordered at a restaurant. They were extremely salty and probably need some tweaking. We also ordered the Escargot and Caesar salad. Both were great.

The entrée, Zack offered to do a Delmonico and Dry Aged Porterhouse split for two. This was the best of both worlds. I wish the steaks were done a bit more as they didn't come out with my understanding of the correct temperature we had ordered. I'd highly recommend the stuffed hash browns and creamed spinach sides.

For a $300+ dollar meal it missed the mark by far. The ambience/wait staff were phenomenal but would definitely recommend dining here during restaurant week as the meal didn't reflect the cost. This is the first time I've written a Yelp review as I've never felt compelled until this experience.",1

1685527,4,"Looking and feeling like a giant freight train just threw me against the wall, and a headache that all the coffee and aspirin in the world couldn't make better, I knew I was in serious trouble. Luckily Garvy's saves the day.
Garvey's is a notch nicer than a hole in the wall grill, but the food is what keeps me coming back. The tenderloin sandwich is a delicious mouthful of sizzled steak and provolone. Appetizers are awesome. Toasted Ravioli, and jumbo sized hot wings with blu cheese and ranch sauces make me feel much better.  
The restaurant itself isn't the nicest, but at noon on a Sunday you can't ask for anything more appealing than good food cheap.
The bar, (not that I needed any more at this point), rocks specials everyday, and Nascar Sundays (Really not into Nascar either) offers pitchers of beers for way cheap. The only problem the bar is full of people watching NASCAR. Overall, a decent place to catch a game, some drinks, and some grub.
Oh, and if you are fortunate to come here on a Sunday lunch trip, the rest of the tables are filled with twenty somethings feeling and looking just like you.",1
1331969,5,"Came for happy hour which is 3-6:30 everyday. They have a $5 small bites menu and $8 drinks. They offer fresh or frozen mojitos and margaritas. I prefer the fresh. Had the fresh strawberry mojito and it was so good I ordered a pitcher after the first glass which was worth the money. 

Good size portions. Even the smaller sizes for happy hour were filling. The entrees (which I was too full and didn't order) were huge. I tried my friends chicken and rice burrito with some kind of avocado cream on it that was heavenly. The yucca fries were cooked well and came with two dipping sauces, one green one that was kind of spicy and a grayish one that was my fav, it tasted like kalamata olives. So good! 

The decor inside is so cute and it's a fun vibe and fun music. They also have covered outside seating. Parking is $5 valet. I would come here again.",1

We basically had all the wait staff checking up on us but not in an annoying way. The food is tapas style and i absolutely love tapas. There are 3 different hummuses, all delicious but i wasnt a huge fan of the hot buttery one. The laffa bread is AMAZING! The seasoning is perfectly flavorful, cooked to the perfect softness. They were so nice, they gave us an extra appetizer on the house. The cocktails were also perfect. Im so glad i was able to get the reservation.",1

My two complaints are:
1) the Ginger Pear martini is delicious however every time i order it, it tastes different. There seems to be no consistency in the recipe like there is with the pomegranate martini or fleur de lis martini. 

2) please replace the toilets in the women's restroom. They are SO low. They remind me of preschool toilets. You are almost on the floor. I always thought it was just me thinking they were low but recently 3 friends made the same comment about it!

You can tell the fries were done in old oil as they tasted like all manner of seafood, and the shrimp po boy was extremely dry (not enough mayo) and the shrimp were not deveined, which grossed me out a bit. The beer was cold, though, and the price was fair. Definitely many, many better po boys to be had in this city, however!",1

And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
And this time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
--Shania Twain

This store is the total bomb. I would fly to Nashville specifically to go here again. Written up in the guidebooks as ""where the locals go to get western style boots"" this place is truly where it's at. The selection is amazing. I have big feet for a woman (size 12... ) and was able to find a pair of amazing pink western style boots in this shop. AMAZING. While that was the only colorful pair that fit my feet, for women with size 10, 9, 8, 7, or smaller, there was a huge variety - blue, turquoise, lime green, pink, purple, red, yellow, black and brown. All very cute. Lots of boots in men's sizes as well. 

I'm only sad that Nashville doesn't have a larger community of drag queens - if it did, perhaps I would have had a wider selection of colorful shoes for my big feet!",1
2241317,5,"Wow! This place is fabulous. Owner must have been working counter because he was working so hard and being so friendly to all during rush hour.
Their take on sandwiches are different enough that you won't feel like it's a standard sandwich lunch. Salads are thoughtful and complex. Sandwiches have their own twists and unique condiments. They make their own sodas on the spot! This is franchise worthy and cannot believe Boise has such an original. Keep it up, Bleubird!

Food was great. I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars because I have had better. It was nothing amazing or anything. But it was really solid breakfast food. I tried as many items as I could in small amounts and nothing was bad. Like another reviewer says below, I've had some truly bad buffets before, and this is not one. 

Between us, my husband and I tried the eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, pancakes, french toast, fresh bread, several danish, biscuits and gravy, and maybe a few others I'm forgetting. All were good and extremely soothing to our hangovers. We'll definitely be back for breakfast. I am deeply mistrustful of dinner buffets, but who knows, maybe I'll give it a day in court.",1

It takes patience, or at least that is my impression. The few times I have been, my friend and I have repeatedly failed to remember closing time. We rush in, madly sweep through rack after rack, try whatever we can over our clothes (no dressing rooms), weigh in on the ones we cannot pull over our heads in time, probably keep most of them on our arms (at that price? worth a shot!), and speed walk to the register. 

So there's a load of crap on the racks; there are still great buys here.  Like I said, got a gown for seven dollars. And it's nice, I promise. Kitschy things are lurking, basic tops, all for just a few bucks with an inherent understanding that you should (must really) run things through the wash before wearing.

My step-brother and I came in just for drinks and we were greeted warmly (thanks Southern hospitality!) and sat at the bar. Our bartender, Virginia, was so informative and friendly. The mango margarita she made for me was so delicious that I had another one, and it was only 2PM.

4905308,3,"The first time I tried Peter's Sushi & Thai, it was a bit of a lack-luster experience. I went with the Pad Thai and didn't find it all that great. Moreover, I couldn't understand justifying the long wait and slow service for the food.

A year later my wife convinced me to give it another shot - this time I went for the Sushi. We've since returned 2 more times. The second time I had sushi again, and the last time I tried the Thai once more. I'll definitely say the Sushi far surpasses the Thai, so I'll likely stick to that.

That being said, the wait and service still leaves something to be desired. Food would be a 4, but Food + Service makes this a 3 for me.",1
5228051,3,"This spot has some good and some not so good.
It's over rated.

The service we received was great - maybe because my bf and I came in with a semi regular patron and the waitress knew him - I'm trying to overlook that and hope that every customer received the same level a service we did.

Our party of 4 arrived on the earlier side of a Sunday evening.
The hostess was not at the station when we entered, and after poking my head around the partition, I saw she was just making herself busy by helping set tables.  She quickly spotted us with a smile and came over.  We were seated immediately at a comfortable table for 4.

It was SUPER dark in the place, like - almost needing a flash light to read the menu.  It only got a little better when the house lights came on.

I went with the sangria as it was a sunday special - rest of the table got margaritas.
Drinks were good - although one in my party didn't like the house tequila, once switched to something ""better"", they were happy with their 2nd.

I cannot believe that chips and salsa weren't complimentary - never mind - it's Manayunk - I can believe it...it was a nominal price to pay.  The salsa was just okay, mild to me, hot for others.   Also everything is a la cart.  Want rice or bean with your taquitos..I mean enchiladas (see below)...prepare to pay $7.50  more on top of the $9.   I'll say now the tortilla chips and guac were the best out of everything we had.  

For the price - I was super let down.
The enchiladas were laughable. 
My bf got them sans sauce (weirdo, ha) and was presented with two maybe 4 inch long taquitos with a tablespoon of shredded chicken inside each.  I literally laughed when the server put them down - for $9....for $9!! he got this laughable dish.  This joint pulls the wool over your eyes, it may look more substantial with the blanket of enchilada sauce, but we saw through the holes for sure.  My carne asada was dismal - they cut the steak and fan it out to make it look like a larger portion.  The steak itself was thin, and when put back together maybe 3.5 inches at the most.  Crazy for $19 and a cheaper cut of meat (flank).

While portion sizes were laughable for the price, the taste was pretty good - admittedly.
I would return and probably order nacho's next time as I saw quite a few orders pass me by and they looked awesome.",1

In fact, if you are Polish and can speak the language, you will probably enjoy the experience more than I did. But I'm getting ahead of myself. It is easy to drive right past this location, which is what I did, twice in fact. On the third attempt I just parked then eventually saw the tiny sign. Upon entering you feel like you have stepped back in time and into another culture. The room has stucco walls with wooden beams and is fairly dark, the best seat in the house is a front window table that is by itself and suitable for a larger party. I arrived for a late lunch and was one of only 3 tables still occupied. I was quickly given a menu, but to get a glass for the Polish lager I brought, took much more time. Part of the holdup seemed to be that one group of diners near me were friends of the owner. She spent a lot of time chatting with them(in Polish) and they all seemed to be having a great time. I was forgotten a bit. Finally she remembered me, and took my order, and the food came out quickly. I started with assorted pierogies, but was given the entree size instead of appetizer. Not the end of the world, 4 or 5 more for $2 more. I am half Polish, and a self described ""Pieroganado"", and these were legit. Perfect dough, and interesting fillings. The filling I wasn't sure I would like, was the one I liked best(sauerkraut and mushroom) The main event was called Gypsy special, and consisted of a huge and excellent potato pancake, that enveloped a serving of a beef stew(Goulash) The gravy was delicious, and just a bit spicy. The meat was of a better cut than is usually used for a stew, and was very enjoyable. I would have liked a few more pieces of it though. I was thinking about trying one of the homemade desserts, but when the bill was left at my table while I was still finishing up, I took that as a sign it was time to go. Throughout the meal the owner may have stopped by once to see how I was doing, and during this same time she had long conversations with the other 2 tables. One was there for coffee and what seemed to be a large take out order. If the food had not been so good the service would have plunged this review into the 3 star range, Before I had settled up on the check, both of the other tables left. In fact one of the ladies even took some time to ask me what I thought of the food, and seemed pleased that I enjoyed everything. She may have noticed the lack of attention I was given while dining. After everyone had left but me, the owner did finally find time to talk, and she is very friendly too. She seemed happy when she noticed my Polish name, but it was a little late for me.

If you had a custom order or a dietary restriction, they, the staff made sure your needs were addressed so that you did not have to worry. Our server for the evening was: Ms. Kyrianne Moore, a two- year, (""2- year""), team member. She was: Pesonable! We each, (the thirteen, 13), of us were greeted with a broad, bright, cheerful smile! We were presented our menus. While we were looking at the menu, Ms. Kyrianne took our drink orders.Upon her return, she asked with her effervescent smile , would we like appetizers?  She cheerfully took our orders, paying special attention to specific, special orders!! The appetizers were served fresh and; hot!! She then took our food orders, again paying special attention to the individual needs of our party! Our meals were brought out in a timely manner. And; no corrections were needed. After serving us, before leaving us to eat, she refilled our drinks and; left us to enjoy our meals. As I eat, because of my profession I watched Ms. Kyrianne interact with her our guests. She was Outstanding in the execution of her duties and responsibilities! Based on my observations, I asked to speak with the on duty manager, Mr. Wesley Cuyler. I introduced myself. And; explained the nature and reason for my request to speak to him. I wanted to recognize Ms. Kyrianne for her: ""Outstanding Customer Service""!! So; in closing, if you either live and/or visit the ""Big Easy"", please treat your taste buds to some extraordinary regional cuisine and; request Ms. Kyrianne Moore as your server. You will not be disappointed by either! Bon Appetite!!",1
6723302,3,"I was taken here by a friend who swears by the breakfast offered.  Who am I to turn down a free breakfast.  I figured he is the type that visits lots of places so I trusted his judgement that the food would be tasty.  I wasn't disappointed.  The breakfast was a buffet with an omelette station.  I enjoyed that fruit, waffles, sausage, bacon, creamed chipped beef and a few other offerings were on the menu.  I went back for seconds and all this if offered for $10.95.  

After reading the reviews, this place seems to run hot & cold, but I can only say - I enjoyed the breakfast and the service was adequate.  Not sure if I would return for other meal times.",1

1572948,3,"Hummus is a good place to get a snack, especially if you like...hummus.

The decor is decent, but most people take it to go.  While I dined in, it was a little difficult to maneuver around the lines to get more sauce or water.  

The falafel was pretty good, and the hummus smooth.  The beet salad was good, even though I usually stay away from that type of dish.  The wholewheat pitas, however, I could eat all day.  Call me crazy, but the hummus and bread would have been enough for me.

Although a bit on the pricey side for what you get, it is far better than going to the McDonald's on the corner.  :op

For a quick snack (except during peak times), Hummus is a good change of pace from the usual fare.",1

They don't have a huge menu for lunch, but the sandwiches, soups and salads are killer. I am a creature of habit, so I always get the NTI Turkey BLT with a Kelly's Salad. I go for the half sandwich deal because it is plenty enough for one hungry person. I love the basil pesto mayo they use on the sandwich and all ingredients are really fresh. My favorite has to be the salad though. They have mixed greens with sauteed onions, dried cranberries, candied walnuts, blue cheese and an amazing balsamic vinaigrette. They have fresh homemade cookies that come to your table warm among other desserts too.

My only complaint is, I wish they were open on weekends. Even just Saturday for lunch. I don't work in the area, so I only get to partake in lunch on Friday's.",1

The quality of service is obvious from the moment you walk through the door. Over the countertop, the grooming station is visible from the front. Dogs waiting for a cut or pick up are separately crated right next to the table, so the dogs are provided constant care and supervision.
My little pup scares easily, but the owner has this incredibly gentle aura; Remy gets excited now when we go to the groomer! We brought our newly adopted dog in after his surgery. She was flexible, and gave him a dry shampoo rub in lieu of a water bath after the cut. 
I was surprised to read the poor reviews. This is a small, local business. No secretary to schedule appointments, so she answers texts between sessions. All business is run through the owner, who is an obvious dog lover and very attentive to her customer's needs. We love Hair of the Dog!",1

He took the time to take me behind the bar and talk to me through the different offerings he had available and why he likes certain brands over others.  His depth of knowledge was very impressive and I took pictures of several bottles I didn't know about to buy for my home.  All in all, it was a fantastic dining experience all around and you could tell how much passion the owner had for his business.

4998150,3,"Ok this place is REALLY comfortable for good coffee like a living room as opposed to tables and chairs everywhere. Couches, fluffy/cushioned living room like chairs, it doesn't feel like a business. HOWEVER ;)...... for me at least, on Saturdays the three times I went over the past few months, they didn't open at the time they say they do (9am). And I don't mean like 5 minutes late, I mean I walk by 20 minutes later and still not open yet. They say 9am which is fine, but for people who want their coffee earlier in the morning, that hurts it for me. But really when you have a place you love to go and they have an opening time and never seem to be open then, it irritates you. If they were reliable in this way I would be at 4.5 stars! I would take off half a star because a good coffee shop should open before 9am even I think, but that is my personal preference. However I only give 3 because of the unreliability of them being open when they say they are open.",1

Place was busy but had a table ready for us even 30 min early.
the early arrivals started drinking from their extensive drink menu. Service by a team of server , drink runner and bus boy was efficient and precise. 
the classic lime daiquiri and the peter's planter punch was good as well as their cosmo.
bread was fresh and wonderful like all Brenner's 
Food was very good.
App crab meat cheesecake, shrimp ramoulade and fried oysters in pan were very good starters. They ran out of the seasonal special sweetbreads :(.

4921303,4,"This place was an interesting find.  I was with a couple friends visiting King of Prussia mall and we were wandering looking around for something different for dinner...and looking among the many eateries there ranging from food court crap (which was still all gourmet) to high priced luxury meals like Morton's and Legal Seafood, this place looked like an interesting and different option somewhere between cheap eats and fine dining.  The environment of the place is pretty nice...typical loud bar area with some booths in the back, and also a full dining room on the mall side of the restaurant.  Lets start with the beer....this establishment has a wide variety on in-restaurant made beers and ales, being a home brewer myself I sampled the ""Pat's Curse"" I believe, and it was REALLY nice.  Very smooth with caramel hints and nice nutty undertone and a nice head..pretty well balanced.  The appetizer sampler was ok..the wings were pretty good, the nachos coulda used a bit more cheese.  My 1 friend and I split a rack of st. Louis ribs with fries and the white cheddar mashed potatoes.  The ribs were FALL OFF THE BONE Tender with a wonderful flavor..nice and smokey with a sweet and mildly tangy sauce with a little kick of spice...I'd definitely have them again.  The mashed potatos were also very good however the cheese in them is VERY sharp so be prepared...I've never had such sharp cheddar potatoes before and I LOVE sharp cheddar cheese so it went well.  Our other friend ordered the Grilled Mahi fish tacos...which I didn't taste but she seemed to enjoy them...she said they also had a slight kick to them.
The portions at this restaurant are fairly big (none of us finished our meal) and the prices aren't bad at all.   If your going to be at king of prussia mall and want something moderately priced....check this place out and have a few pints and a nice meal :)",1

5433110,5,"Located in the middle of the Reading Terminal Market. My friends and I tried the famous Roast Pork Sandwich, which had been featured on the Travel Channel as the best sandwich in America. The line was a bit long, but the wait wasn't too bad as my friend waited to purchase while the rest of us went to look for a table. We ordered the roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone cheese. Simple, yet a perfect combination. Sandwich is huge, btw! Definitely shareable. We split the sandwich into three portions just because we wanted to save our appetite for donuts after. I thought this sandwich was amazingly delicious! Yes, it's a bit greasy but it was just too delicious! The roast pork was tender and very juicy. The bread was soft yet flavorful from the roast pork's juice. Definitely recommend Tommy DiNic's roast pork sandwich if you're in Philly! :)",1

4616226,5,"The only way I can describe the Bleu Louie burger at Bar Louie is that the experience of mouth meeting burger is like Hendrix meeting guitar. Instant magic. If you don't order this, you deserve to get your toenails removed by rusty pliers.

The beer list is quite fantastic. I checked it once, then checked it twice, and couldn't decide if it was a night to be naughty or nice. Ultimately, I went with Sam Adams because picking a beer was just such a tough call!

As for the service..

Well, intense love does not measure it just gives. Once upon a time, this was said about Mother Teresa, but it's never applied to someone as well as our waitress, wait, I mean our friend, Jessica. Funny, beautiful, charming, quick to serve...does somebody have a thesaurus HA! When my friends began to tease me about my awkward and uncomfortable behavior, she stood up for me...need I say more about this girl!

If you go to Bar Louie, you're in for a 5-star experience. If Jessica is leading your dining experience, you're gonna wish Yelp had an extra star!",1

1958795,5,"Excellent Kosher-style deli. The meats are top-notch, on the level of the top 5 Kosher-style delis in NYC. The prices are totally fine, and the line is nothing at all. I've forgotten 2x in a row, but it's a good idea for your wallet, your stomach, and your colon to get the half sandwich/half soup combo. 

Another tip - Locals or people who think they are cool like to get the Rachel. It's a Ruben with cole slaw instead of sauerkraut (I think that's it). BUT, as opposed to a lot of people reviewing, I would not recommend Reubenizing a pastrami sandwich or even putting cheese on it. It's kind of sacrilegious to me and mucks up a perfect thing: pastrami/corned beer, soft rye, mustard. 

Reading Terminal Market is such a must-visit, and this is probably my favorite place to eat a meal there.",1

5005808,4,"We were visiting my mom in AZ and decide to take my 15 month old to the zoo for the first time.  I like how small this zoo was only because we could fit in most everything before the little man was ready for his nap.  It was very clean and offered great views of all the animals.

The zoo is very interactive and at almost every cage or compound there was someone there to answer questions and give you general information about the animals.  I LOVED that the peacocks were just randomly walking around, although you had to be careful of the ones in the trees #poopalert!!!

The camel rides looked like so much fun and it was great that you could feed the giraffes.  We got to see the baby elephant Nandi.....so cute!  My son enjoyed looking at all the animals, I think his favorite were the ducks, sea otters and the ball the bears were playing with!

My husband did make a comment about how some of the cages seemed a little small for certain animals.  While not a zoo expert, I felt the same way.  Next time we visit we'll gladly come back!!",1

6312992,5,"I give Stoveworks five stars because I like it, yes, but most importantly because this is about the only restaurant I know of in Franklin where we can take our dog to have lunch with us.

Yes, your pet-friendly table is just outside the brick wall of the patio, but it's fine and so fun.  All the shoppers in The Factory will want to stop and visit, which makes it even more fun.

I usually get the Salad Sampler, which is a yummy chicken salad, cranberry jello salad, and a muffin - but this last time I opted for a grilled chicken salad.  It was good, but the salad sampler is better.  Hubby had a burger that he compared on par with Bunganut Pig's in Franklin... which in our book is very, very good.

If you are a fruit tea fan - you're in luck, it's wonderful here.  And where else can you get a fried bologna sandwich in town, really?

So bring your pup and head on over, you'll see - it's so fun!",1

Great for groups. Great to sit outside and people watch.",1
2858988,5,"love, love, LOVE this place. I was a fan, even before it was rebuilt after the fire. ( ias crushed when it burned down!) But I think the new decor is even better! Funky, hip, a visual delight, this place rocks. The menu items listed in other reviews are great. But to be honest, my husband & I probably ate 15-20 times there in the lounge, off the appetizer menu, before we even had a sit-down dinner there! Its delish ( BBQ duck quesadilla and the carne asada flatbread a must) The lounge is uber-cool, visually stunning ( LOVE the double headed medusa-like metal centerpiece!). We live 1/2 the year in San Francisco, and sure, there is no way to compare Boise to SF when it comes to dining. But this place is the hippest, most fun place Boise has going it for it. And could compete in a lot bigger city. We have had great meals there,fun group happy hours (2:1 drinks 4-6pm daily), and late night drinks. Its all great. The decor is insane. Love all the furniture, variety of funky wall decor & lighting, and so nice to have  a place play more progressive, lounge music. We take people here every time we have visitors, and pretty much go 2x a month on our own. OH! And in the summer, the rooftop bar is open too! Go, enjoy!",1
2014686,3,"I am adding a star. I realize that I expected more than I should have from these guys. My added star is literally due to the ease of breaking my lease. I mean, we've had a few bumps, but all in all the process was simple. Go get a money order for the last month's rent, pay back any promos, and give 60 days of notice. You can technically leave before those 60 days are up. I am writing this from Tampa Florida. 

I had one small bump. I got my email that my rent was due, but it showed a credit. I figured that I had one more month to pay, but I got confused, so I was like...well, maybe I'm done. A few days later Kelley emailed me to see what was up. I definitely appreciate her professionalism, so as soon as I got home to access some funds and transfer things around I made my payment. I should be done now, hopefully never to hear anything but positive about Tucson ever ever again. 

To be fair, the tenants were the cause of most of my grief, between the drug deals outside, and the little hootchie girls trying to date my sons, even after I ask their parents to keep their little fast selves away from my child etc, (and no, he isn't innocent, but come on, a bit of help mother of girls?) Anyways, I am glad to be out. I moved to a luxury complex in Florida, and the difference is night and day, but to be fair, there are still issues, as I guess there will be in housing developments. Prospective tenants, if you don't have kids (the school district sucks, all of Tucson schools pretty much) you will be fine. I disliked the laundry facility. I disliked the bedbug scare, but for the most part, it was an uneventful 7 months. Yes, I vacated super early. I had things to do and people to see! It has been real Overlook. Oh, hell. I'll add one more star for the new girl from the day I left. You were super polite and I hope your new career is incredible!

I hope I don't have to update this review again. LOL!",1
2319834,4,"Peter McAndrew's newest offering cements the Irishman's position as the undisputed king of Modern Italian in this city. 

Thats right I said it.  

Sorry, South Philly. Step up your game and get outside grandma's recipe book. 

That goes double for Vetri and clan. The Main Liners can have them (and pay double as well). 

Paesanos already makes the best sandwiches in a sandwich town,  Monsu has pioneered Siciliano Nuovo,  Modo Mio blows up your idea of a Red Gravy place, and now Popolino does a fresh take on what they are calling ""Roman Trattoria"".

You've got to get the Tavole Calde  - the antipasti bar that dominates the dining room. Much more nuanced in terms of flavors and textures than I was expecting.

The Calamari fritti were exceptional with notes of Ginger and Mint ?!?! I was floored. 

The Spaghetti Carbonara is typically a layup...but I have certainly had better... the best pasta at the table was their special lasagna w/crepes instead of noodles, creamy spinach bechamel, and a rosé sauce.

Everything was made up for by the Involtino de Manza, which is code for ""The Best Braciole you've ever had"". 

Dolce and Coffee felt like and afterthought and could use some work.

The meal had ups and downs, but the bright spots won by a mile. The Antipasti are clear winners, and I might consider coming back simply to try them all.

Piece of Advice: You don't need the 4 course ""Menu Turista"". They will tell you it's the only way to dine with them. Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing, but you will eat every bite of those 4 courses and you will roll your fat ass out that door. Just pick 2-3 things and come back again (and again).

It was a busy weekend in New Orleans so we were thankful to not have to wait to be seated and able to get some great food. We ordered a few dishes to share and everyone of them were delicious. The Island Breeze salad with pecans, cranberries, and pineapples over spring lettuce could easily be ordered as an entree due to its size. Definitely a good choice for Vegans. The St. Thomas which was sautéed shrimp with yellow, red, and green peppers in curry sauce. I didn't actually taste this but it had to be delicious because it was gone in a matter a minutes. The Hellshire Whole is a whole red snapper (bone in) in brown stew. This was cooked to perfection. You could tell time was taken to prepare this meal. I ordered  the Portland which is their take on Jerk chicken, also very delicious. Not too spicy, so you're able to actually enjoy the flavors.
Each entree came with 2 sides. We had the rice and peas, the fabulous cabbage and tasty mixed vegetables. Everything was delicious. 
The service could've been better as we had to continually summon the waitress to our table for refills, straws and extras. Not a big deal since the food made up for it. I'll definitely return when I'm in NOLA. 
This is definitely a hidden gem of the beaten path.",1

Of course the Sun King beers are delicious every time. They also feature special, low volume batches that you can't find anywhere else. They have also added a new section that sells local foods which is great if you want a bite to eat!

I came here most recently for an event; Sun King was awesome and even blocked off a section of their room for us to hang out together. We were even allowed to bring in games for the event also!

4365447,5,"Waited a long time to try this place. The wait is over. Tonight I celebrate my birthday with one of my favorite friends. Neither of us have been here, it was just us girls. We arrived during happy hour. The bar had a few patrons and the restaurant just had 2. We looked at each other in disbelief because the reviews made this place out to be ""the place"".
The quite intimate setting didn't last for long. We were met by a delightful and knowledgeable server, Mimi. She's been here for 2 plus years. She welcomed us and reminded us that although we could order from the menu, that it was happy hour and suggested we also check out that menu.
From 4 to 6 nightly is happy hour and we were really happy. There is a Chardonnay, a merlot and a Cabernet for $4 and an assortment of beer as well as cocktails. We had the Sangria at Mimi's recommendation. Nice choice.
Mimi recommended the cauliflower ceviche as well as the veggie tamale from the $6 per item happy hour menu, a menu consisting of more than 10 items, with a diverse pallet selection.
We decided to share the items and made our selections like a ""tapas"" restaurant.  We started with Mimi's recommendations, the cauliflower ceviche and the veggie tamale followed closely by the pork tacos and braised short ribs. Although we could not stuff anything else into our stomachs, we continued to order the prosciutto and arugula pizza as well as the mushroom and white truffle Mac and cheese. Let me just say this, until you try this place, DON'T JUDGE. You too will find yourself releasing the first button on your pants to make room for more.
Upon completion, we chose the beet cheesecake and coffee, after all what's a birthday celebration without dessert? That's right, BEET cheesecake. Shredded beats whipped with lighter than air cream cheese atop a shortbread crust, drizzled with an infused honey orange balsamic vinegar streaked with a chunky and refreshing orange marmalade. A decedent savory and slightly sweet dessert made by Reno Provisions, another local eatery.
The flavor profiles were complex and complimentary. The portions were spot on for sharing. Of course, there was more than enough for one person. The choices were exemplary, if you can't find something to eat, you're not hungry.
I am not a food snob nor a food critic. However, my mother wrote a cookbook and exposed me to the many wonders of food and its diversity. With that, my take on this place? Well, I'm glad that I live 45 minutes away, otherwise I would be here once a week. 
The atmosphere is casual with a warm cozy feel. There's an outdoor lighted seating area for a warm summer's eve. Although this was my first time here, it most definitely will not be my last. 
I give this place a 10. It might have something to do with the fact that it was my birthday celebration that I am so generous, so I guess I'll just have to try it again. Until then, treat yourself to a great happy hour experience. I'm glad we did.",1
5255767,4,"Went to this place a while back with a friend. I had been searching for an Ethiopian place since moving here from the DC metro area. After doing a bit of searching on Yelp, I decided to try it.

We ended up going on a Saturday afternoon in mid November. When we got there, we were the only people in the restaurant and it was pretty chilly inside. Part of that was because the space is pretty small, so any time someone opened the door, cold air rushed in and filled the space. However, I'm not even sure the heat was even on. It was so cold, we ended up leaving our jackets on the entire time. 

The service was fine. We were greeted once we walked in and our orders were taken shortly after we sat down. As for the food, it was nothing to write home about. We the had the Combination for Two, which included dohro wet, kitfo ground beef, and wet lamb. Of the three dishes, my favorite was probably the ground beef. They provide plenty of injera to scoop the meat and sides. Overall the meal was good, but I was a bit let down. The glowing reviews I had read for this place had gotten me really excited and my experience didn't really match them. I've had better at several other places in DC. There are a few other Ethiopian places nearby that I'm looking to check out in the near future. And I may come back to Meskerem just to see if I have a different experience the next time.",1
2780684,4,"Order: Double Chocolate Scone and Apple Rose
Price: $9
Pros: Really good pastry, chocolate wasn't overly sweet
Cons: Scone was actually a little big

Thoughts: First off, when I saw the name Bittersweet Confections I think I was expecting more chocolate and ""desert"" shop than it turned out to be. It was much more like a pastry shop/bakery, serving various scones, pastries, and baked goods. We wrapped a double chocolate scone and an apple rose and sat down a nearby to wrap up out night with some deserts.

Both deserts were very well done. The chocolate scone was HUGE and had a really rich chocolate flavor. It wasn't too sweet but the chocolate also wasn't so bitter that you needed up with a dry ""chalky"" pastry. My only major complaint with it was it was so freakin big I almost felt overwhelmed by how much there was to eat. My personal favorite was the apple rose. It was very well crafted, and looked as good as it tasted. You definitely got the look of a blooming rose from the item and it was a good balance of apple and pastry.

While we didn't end up returning in this trip (so much other food to eat during out short time here) it was definitely a great way to wrap up the night of eating at the St Roch Market.",1
3480268,4,"Went to this place just before Covid-19 blew up.

Nice cozy little cafe. They have ample seating. Couches and regular chairs. Books you can read on the shelves. Would be nice to go with a good book or a labtop and hang out.

5015504,4,"Our 8 year old just LOVES ruby's.  Everything from the train that runs around the track on the ceiling to the red & white decor and uniforms and the ""old fashioned"" feel.

It's really 3 star food - salads, burgers and fried chicken and fish - but it's a fun place to take the kiddo. Kiddo always gets a (small) milkshake. I usually splurge on a vanilla diet coke ($2.89 - but free refills).

4043931,5,"Came with a group of friends/family to celebrate me and my husband's 31st wedding anniversary.   I heard about Assembly through a relative who came for cocktails.  I thought this would be the perfect meet up spot before heading to dinner. 

This rooftop bar is a lounge that services bar food and cocktails which fit the bill for me and my group of 11.  The place is located in the Logan Hotel on the 9th floor.  There is no cover and no reservations.  It's first come first serve.    The views are of the Ben Franklin Parkway and the art museum.

Once you stepped off the elevator there is staff to greet you. We arrived around 8 ish.  The crowd was a small which was fine since we had a large party.  The hostess at first sat us near the ledge with a great view.  We hadn't even gotten our drinks and another hostess came over to say ""I have good news and bad news"".  My heart started to drop thinking we would have to move and loose this beautiful view.  The good news was we were being seated by the fire pit.  Yes!!!!

My group and I headed over to the fire pit, ordered drinks, took lots of pics and had a blast. . The air was crisp, the drinks was flowing with a beautiful flame hitting our faces.  We couldn't have ask for a better night.    As I stated, we had dinner reservations so we couldn't stay long but will be back for sure.",1

5522616,5,"Okay, this tour was great! Note that during the construction time at Stearn's Wharf, the pickup location has moved to Cabrillo and Chapala (this realization caused us to miss our 15-minute-before-departure call time). We were last in line with little hope, but we luckily made it with very few seats to spare!

The tour had a plethora of information about the city and it's landmarks (at times going slightly too fast and pointing out some insignificant restaurants along the way/places that were somehow tied to our guide), but was enjoyable and entertaining, complete with corny jokes. We drove by some places that we weren't planning on checking out, but after driving by and hearing about them, we ended up making the trek back and visiting those landmarks on foot. 

This vehicle, which I believe he mentioned weighs 14,000lbs, similar to the ""Duck Tour"", drives right into the marina and out into the open ocean. We were free to roam about the cabin when we were in the water, which was great because we got to snap some awesome pictures of seals, sea lions, water birds, and the 3 grey whales we spotted (!!!) A quick history and guide to the surrounding islands was also given during this part of the tour.

6479395,5,"My husband and I purchased a chef's table brunch for six from a silent auction that we attended. From the moment I called to make a reservation to the minute we left the restaurant, I was treated with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Vance was our amazing host who greeted us and treated us with a most wonderful dining experience. We got to start off with a mimosa and then continued to eat some of the best brunch menu items we've had. We started with Belgian waffles topped with strawberry rhubarb compote and chantilly cream. The waffles were a perfect combination of light and crispy. Next, we had ""the cure"". Central Social Hall's version of eggs Benedict poutine. The best part is that the poutine is topped with housemade red wine gravy and the top is finished with a roasted poblano white cheddar sauce. Again, made special in house. Next course was the ""Beautiful salad"". It was exactly that. Avocado hummus base topped with ribbon carrots, candy cane beets, watermelon radish, cucumber, grape tomatoes, spinach, quinoa and toasted sunflower seeds. The dressing was an apple cider vinaigrette and not too overpowering. Our next course was a vegan friendly dish. The ""Thai red curry""  A delicious mixture of cauliflower, red pepper, and chickpeas in a red curry sauce made with coconut milk. Served with brown rice and grilled sourdough naan. Of course, we finished with the doughnuts. Made in-house from their own sourdough starter. These happy endings are dusted in cinnamon, refined and powdered sugar. There is a rosemary anglaise dip to just put you over the top. I can't even say which dish was my favourite as they were all so good. It's very obvious that they use the freshest and most local ingredients for their dishes. Due to this experience, my husband and I will definitely continue to go try as many of the menu items as we can. It was for sure one of our best brunches ever. Thank you Vance and thank you Central Social Hall.",1

The CREME BRULEE FRENCH TOAST was to DIE FOR.  Best french toast I ever had.  My sister also loved it, and she is very picky about french toast!   The SMOKED SALMON LOX BENEDICT was also amazing, they give you two big rolls of salmon with a chive cream cheese rolled up inside, was delicious, and a ton of salmon for the price, and 2 eggs benedict with home fries (rosemary or onions/peppers).
The smoked salmon omelette was also very good, but I liked the benedict better - you get more salmon with the benedict.   We also ordered a side of scrapple (I love that stuff!) and it was a very large piece, cut nice and thick.

The coffee is good, comes with real sugar cubes! Cute!  They have a ""specials"" menu with changing breakfast items, which is nice to try something different.   CASH ONLY, but there's an ATM. 

Only downfall, this place is always packed during breakfast hours, expect to wait 20-30 minutes for a table.  However, they just constructed a new side of the dining room with more tables, so that should help with the wait.  Anyway, you know its good when everyone wants to wait for the food!  

Best breakfast for the cheap price, portion sizes are large so you won't leave hungry!  Go here, many times!",1

6243668,5,"We stumbled upon this place while running some errands. So glad we did. As soon as we walked in our server Sheila smiled and welcomed us.  The draft beer was ice cold and frosty. We decided to try the Philly cheese steak and split it.  Oh my God, so good!  Next we saw someone order the nachos with pulled pork.  We decided we would split that too.  Another great choice everything was perfect . The cook even came out and said hi.  Please support your local businesses during this tough time with the Covid-19.  Highly recommend food and service five stars. Give them a try!",1

1560357,5,"This place is incredible. Bummed it took me so long to make it in since I'm frequently in the Wedgewood-Houston area. Honestly, its the best places for smoked meats in the Nashville area!

This might sound crazy, but it actually fits a healthy diet/lifestyle really well. I'm from California and always frustrated trying to find anything decently healthy to eat. Since the meats are smoked and I don't go crazy on the sides, it works well for me. Maybe not what everyone would be expecting to hear, but I really appreciate that. 

Highly recommend!",1

4365363,4,"Came back about a week ago, didn't have any issues with regards to the substitution which was pleasant. I do enjoy coming here as the food is good. 

I will say that maybe yall should be a bit more lenient on the substitution portion, would completely understand if trying to sub in a meat as per the cost ratio, but would say that the overall savings is a lot better if a customer is not wanting any veggie and would rather a base when they are doing the regular 2.2.2 meals and go for 3.0.2 or the sorts.  Would recommend as I have done.",1

I highly recommend sharing both the hot and cold appetizer samplers, a large bowl of clam chowder, 2 oyster shooters and an order of the fish and chip appetizer. This will fill your belly and your soul! Yum!

Dr.Hall carefully explained the most beneficial alternatives to enhancing my look.

I liked the car and decided to come back the next morning to drive it again in the daylight and talk about prices.

Alyssa is a master of color and always asks a lot of questions to fully understand what I'm looking for. She's also very honest about what it will take to achieve my color goals, such as more frequent appointments or new techniques. She's great at cuts and always helps me keep a fresh shape without sacrificing my length.

My wife enjoyed the free glass of wine, thank you Yelp ! We ordered the meat sampler for two. It was excellent. Every piece of meat was tender & cooked properly. The sausage was flavorful. We would definitely order it again. Knowing we wouldn't finish everything, we brought airtight containers to keep our goodies fresh on our trip home the next day. Took a couple caramel cannolis with us to have with coffee in the morning. They were delicious. We enjoyed our dinner at Renzo's very much, thank you Martin ( pronounced Mar- teen ).

This place is amazing; a little short on ambiance, but boy do they make up for it with food!

We started with the Vegetable Samosas.  It's described as ""Crispy stuffed vegetable pyramid filled with potatoes and mild spices.""  I say these are incredible little potato pillows and I want MORE.  Best part of the meal, for sure, but that's not to say the other dishes were lacking.  This was just THAT GOOD.

I had the Saag Shrimps (Delicious shrimps Masala cooked with spinach and fresh spices for added flavor) as my entree along with the Jalapeno Cilantro Naan.  This was super green and dark, loaded with shrimp and Indian/Pakistani spices, and absolutely wonderful (although still not as good as the Samosas.  Oh man!).  New to Indian food, so I'm not even sure how to describe it, except to say it was scrumptious.

My friend ordered the Smoked Chicken Masala, a chef's special.  Ok, this was really close to the Samosas for being tasty; not as exotic tasting as the Saag, but super delicious and with a little creamy aspect the Saag was lacking.  The Garlic Naan on the side really complimented the dish.

6389914,3,"As a disclaimer, I don't know too much about Chicago style pizza, so I'm writing the review about just my experiences here. I hear from other reviews that the pizza's not Chicago-style at all, but I don't know if this is their old way of doing things or are trying something different.

The atmosphere was pretty nice, got wood furniture and comfortable lighting, so that's a plus. The waiter was friendly, did everything he could to please his customers. And I'm impressed that there are 110 beers here, which in itself seems outlandish. Definitely not a bad place to hang out. And the restaurant was mostly empty, with a few people here and there, at about ten or eleven on a Friday night, so it wasn't bad at all.

Pizza could definitely be better though. Perhaps it is the old-style way, but I just thought it was too greasy and buttery. It's not bad, just needs work. The other items people got looked pretty good, I'll acknowledge that. And I would like to try the pepperoni rolls, especially since it reminds me of the deceased Pizza Pucks restaurant that used to run at home. Nostalgic moment there.

Overall, 3 stars, although I'd give it 3.5 if I could. I'd come here again if something was going on, but wouldn't like to bring people here unless it got better or if I found something better on the menu.",1

I can live the good life everyday with memories of my holiday at a Four Seasons hotel for a tiny fraction of the cost; I deserve it.

The service used to be outstanding until the end of last Summer; now it's less than spectacular.

The bowl was kinda small and for the price, too. I actually thought this place was better than Pho Bistro in IV. There was more flavor in the soup.

6199962,4,"Gordon's is a hidden gem of the Nashville brunch scene. Located off Franklin Pike in the Melrose area, there is a small lot behind the storefront and it is attached to other businesses.  There isn't a host/hostess but there is a sign when you enter indicating to seat yourself. We were greeted by the bartender who encouraged us to have a seat at the bar. We grabbed the last two seats at the bar and were handed our menus. 

Ambiance: 
The ambiance is very casual but slightly nicer vibe than a bar. The bar area is a large square shape and the bar stools are comfortable. There are a few tables inside and a patio outside (which was too cold for anyone to be out there). The women's restroom was clean. 

Drinks: 
We decided to indulge in the bottomless mimosas ($16) while watching some football. The mimosas are pre-mixed, but never fear they are not watered down. The bartender was excellent about refilling it and if you plan on drinking more than 2 mimosas you will certainly get your money's worth ($7/ single mimosa). 

Food: 
I decided to get the biscuits and gravy ($5.50), which is 2 buttermilk biscuits that is topped with fried chicken, gravy, a fried egg and cheese. I will say that the price is right for this dish. It is filling, delicious and cheap! My friend wanted to get the chicken & waffles ($10.00) but the waffle machine was down so they were serving pancakes with it. Although I thought this sounded like an odd combination my friend still ordered it and was satisfied with the results. The dish is 3 pieces of fried chicken, pancakes and fries. I tried a bite and somehow the pancakes did work with the whole thing. 

Service: 
The bartender was great about refilling our drinks. He was friendly and attentive. The service was great on our visit! 

Overall great experience and I will be back for another excellent brunch experience soon. Their dinner menu looks great and some of their desserts look sinfully delicious as well. Would recommend Gordon's for a casual yet good experience!",1
5035008,5,"This is my favorite bar in Philadelphia. I can't put my finger on any one thing that I like the most about it. It has a great atmosphere, the music is done just by a touch tunes machine but the people who go there usually play some pretty good music. The pitchers are CHEAP, about 7 bucks each and they give you glass mugs to drink from which I love. There is tons of seating and you can push tables together to make long ones if you're in a big group. 

McGillans is the perfect place to start your night out. You can't get really drunk for much cheaper in the city. Once I'm hammered I usually go to bars that I can only tolerate when I'm drunk, but staying at McGillin's all night isn't bad either.

This place gets pretty crowded Friday and Saturday nights but there has only been once or twice where I was never able to get a table. There are two floors so there is usually a good amount of space to move around. Even though this place is always very crowded the waitresses and bar tenders do a very good job at making sure you always have a full pitcher or drink. If your mug is empty you won't have to wait very long for it to be filled again. 

The food here is decent. I usually just get the Texas/Western Fries/Nachos or whatever they're called. and they are delicious. It is seriously a mountain of food and could probably feed 6 people easily. 

McGillian's is really a fine establishment and one of the best bars I have had the privilege to patronize. You can't go wrong with spending a weekend night there.",1

We started off with some BEIGNETS, which were incredibly fresh and indulgent. However, they were definitely not beignets, but clearly donut holes. They were very light and fluffy, some filled with the most flavorful berry jam and others filled with yummy hazelnut chocolate.

Next was a SWEET CORN CAKE. Some deemed this the best course. It was bursting with a whirlwind of intense flavors, and the corn patties were piping hot, creamy, and tender.

Next was the PESTO BEAN SOUP. Everyone raved about how delicious this was. Unfortunately, I couldn't indulge because it had an animal-based broth (I'm vegetarian).

We were then presented with a BERRY CITRUS SALAD. I hate arugula, but this dish somehow made it enjoyable! The dressing was light, but complemented the bitterness of the arugula very nicely. The pistachios and berries tied the plate together perfectly.

Although we were already stuffed, we still had our entrees to devour. Since we were a group of five, we decided to get all four entrees and share. Personally, the BANANA BUCKWHEAT PANCAKES were my favorite. The cakes were very hearty and dense, and it was dressed with a light drizzle of bourbon-maple syrup and some dollops of pecan butter, both of which complemented the nuttiness of the pancake perfectly. Another highlight was the SEA BASS PROVENÇAL, which was utterly rich and decadent, but extremely satisfying.

For dessert, we were presented with a gorgeous array of four fantastic PETITE FLOURS. Each had their own unique and pronounced tastes, and it was very fun guessing their flavors.

Although the food was amazing, the service we was not on-par. Our server was very uptight, and did not know the first thing about the ingredients of the dishes. Furthermore, we were not presented with any kind of menu, which would've been nice.

On the way out, I decided to pick up some items from their bakery. I chose one ALMOND CROISSANT, one BUTTER CROISSANT, one LEMON BAR, and a piece of CARAMEL BREAD PUDDING. All were incredible. The croissants are huge and perfectly executed, and the bread pudding was tender, moist, and deliciously rich. The best of all though was the lemon bar. I can say with little doubt that this was the best lemon bar I've ever had. The shortbread base had chunks of lavender in it that elevated its sophistication above all others. The lemon curd had the perfect amount of sweetness. This gem was a perfect balance of unique flavors, and I'll be returning many more times just for that.",1

It's so good it's all I order so I haven't had the pleasure of trying anything else. The seafood penne bolognese is really delicious, a huge portion of well cooked pasta, a flavorful sauce ( they put enough but I usually ask for extra on the side), and the main ingredient: LOTS of seafood including shrimp, scallops, and lump crabmeat. They do NOT skimp on the seafood at all. Every bite you take has seafood in it. ThAnk me now and try it ASAP",1

A couple of weeks ago, my dad wanted pizza.we didn't have any coupons, but we could think of only one place that deserves our business, so... to the Pizza factory we went. 
Service is always decent when the order is taken, but the people working behind the counter surprise me. They go above and beyond what would be required. A mistake was made in our order which would not have been known, but they told us and we actually benefited from the error! 
The owner was there and again, I was surprised that he remembered my dad and myself!
Though I like some of the chain pizza places near Scheels, it can't compare the the ""Cheers"" type of atmosphere when you walk into this place. It really means something when you become a semi regular and they know who you are. 

Now, for the food. The pizza is still surprisingly good! The crust has a good taste, not too doughy, crunchy and tasty. The toppings we got were sun dried tomato and mushroom. Too great tastes that taste great together!  The tomato sauce was good, not too light which is how I like it. Each ingredient has its time to shine when food is prepared correctly.

As with pizza and ice cream shops, this place isn't for everyone. A reason why Baskin Robins has 31 flavors. It's worth the drive. Come out here and try them out. 

Things that I liked this time over my last visit are the addition of real plates for the salad and pizza! Kudos! I really like that touch.

We had the kani salad as an app and it was good. A decent portion and the sauce was tasty with a bit of spice.

We then split some rolls. The rolls came out in a timely manner and were prepared nicely. We had the spicy girl roll, eel naruto, and tako roll. We liked the tako and spicy girl rolls alot but the eel naruto was just ok. Its wrapped in cucumber and can be hard to pick up especially with chopsticks.

Overall we had a good experience and would go there again. Its a decent sushi place in KOP.",1

Their homemade salsa is really good, which is one of the most important components for a taco shop! The red salsa is MAJORLY hot so use caution (ten cuidado). My husband got the banana smoothie which was pretty gross - basically frothy banana milk that wasn't really cold. So go for the tacos and skip the smoothies.",1

This is a very small restaurant and seems to always have a steady stream of people coming in for sit down, or take out.  The service is friendly and great.

2845962,4,"Being mid-town regulars, especially on weekends (see 2 chicks) we have meant to visit Chuy's several times, and finally made it in Friday night. Being typical midtown, we feared that we would have a huge parking debacle and long wait time, but no problem. Parking was fine and we got a front spot (unheard of in midtown). The restaurant was ""busy"" but we didn't have to wait for a seat. I'm a huge frozen drink connoisseur, and Chuys doesn't disappoint, not only do they have great menu drinks, but a full bar as well, even making my fiancée a Mango Daiquiri. yum! 

The menu-

I have some qualms with Chuy's menu, only for one reason. It isn't representative of how good their kitchen is. I'm pretty picky when it comes to veggies on my food (tough with Mexican) and hardly anything on the menu really appealed to my taste buds, at least visually. I ""custom"" ordered chicken tacos with rice and beans and my girl ordered the fish tacos.

Service was ""good"" not amazing, due in part to both of our cocktail glasses going empty for well over 15 min without being offered a refill, a no brainer for a restaurant to make easy money. 

Our food arrived rather quickly and the appearance was amazing. Great presentation, and everything piping hot! My marinated chicken tacos were great, although they come in the small authentic corn tortillas which aren't my first preference. But alas the taste made up for it. Their small hot salsa that accompanies each plate is amazing and is a great addition to the already great spices in the food. The dishes are authentically Mexican and devoid of overspicing, which I appreciate but tend to spice up on my own. The sides (rice and beans) are different than I've had at other Mexican spots. The rice comes in a ""dish shaped pile"" and had amazing taste and consistency, and the beans are whole pinto beans and come in a side dish that are equally yummy. 

I had a hard time only giving Chuy's a 4 rating, but the lack of drink service took off a star. Had we been offered drinks more than the one follow up, we would have stayed longer and probably had dessert as well.",1
5881828,4,"Some things on the menu are fantastic and one of the best you can get. Others are so so. Stick with fried and tried in this restaurant.

512716,5,"One of my favorite sushi places in the Philly metro. As others have noted, portion size is a bit small and service can be slow, but you really should be here for the food. It is also BYOB, and is a fun experience to go with a small group of friends here. Have been her a good number of times, and can recommend the sushi plates and many of the maki rolls (this is the place to go for fancy rolls IMO, along with Morimoto and Zama). Probably one special maki with a traditional maki or an appetizer is enough for a meal. Not best idea to come here for hot entrees, but this is really a sushi place mostly.

It is in a tough area for parking (all of E. Passyunk can be tough), and the restaurant can be somewhat loud as it is small with hard floors/walls.

5892516,3,"The menu can be a little hit or miss here. 

The only reason I come to Square Peg is when I am craving their Mac&Cheese grilled cheese sandwich with a side of tomato soup. Yes, it's exactly what it sounds like! Extra cheesy mac and cheese layered thick and surrounded by buttery, toasted bread. The tomato soup is thicker than most, but I enjoyed the extra spice that was in it...perhaps a little chipotle chili pepper. 

I was VERY disappointed in their wings. I had read a couple of great reviews about them but I found them pretty disgusting and actually sent them back. I found the flavor of the honey,chipotle,basil, and lime sauce to be very unflattering even though it sounds delicious. The meat was dry and a bit gristly. It seemed like they had been cooked too long or left under a warming lamp. Earlier in the summer they had white chocolate chicken wings which I much preferred to the current ones.",1

5172932,3,"This Pub has fallen from its Perch. I used to LOVE this bar, but it's quickly going down hill. 

I'll start with the great things about this place: it's got an amazing view of Broad St... I love the view at night. I'm sure there are many upscale restaurants envious of Perch Pub's view. Also, the food here is really good. I could eat the vegetarian Mediterranean sandwich every day of my life... they put enough butter on that toast to make Paula Deen blush. Lastly, they do have a really good, quality beer selection.

What's happened to this place? I had some friends down from New York the other week and I kept telling them about Perch, and that we just had to go for dinner. We went and had a great meal and ordered drinks afterward, didn't realize what time it was until we were being kicked out. Granted, it was past 2am, but the waitress was incredibly rude, saying, ""You have to leave, we're closed."" She just started clearing our table off as if we'd already left. But, to her credit, it was late and who wants to work past 2am?

The last time I went, it was during Beer Week and I told some local friends that they have the best nachos, and that it's smothered with wonderful avocado. I also mentioned that they have one of my favorite beers, Merry Monk's Ale. We go and we all order the beer and 10 minutes later the slower-than-slow waiter tells us that they are out of Merry Monks. Bummer. My friend orders the nachos and whatdayaknow... it's sans the 'cado! WTH! He had to order it on the side. By the way, they've definitely downsized the portion of the nachos.

I know it sounds like I'm on a hate rant... I would still recommend this place but it's no longer my favorite. Definitely swing by for a great meal and an added brew.",1

Today was the most perfect day to sit outside on their dog friendly patio filled with seashells on the ground! Must be tropical every step we take right?!

We decided what to order & I had to try their Shooting Star sparkler which was a berry basil drink. I found it quite unique, & like the basil in it. It was a nice surprise and it made me want more. I will want a carafe next time. They also had an apple flavor as well. With that, I had the tuna poke. I have been loving tuna poke a lot. It came with the very sticky rice! It was good & flavorful. There is a lot of rice, so don't fill up too fast!

After that we ordered our entrees, Mauna Kea for my hubby & Loco Moco for me! I loved both of these and out of the two, Mauna Kea(shredded beef) was my favorite. It doesn't have a sauce of any sort which my hubby is use to. It does have a nice juice flavor. My loco moco is different than I have tried because of the garlic herb sauce. It's lighter with not as much of a flavor as other gravies. What really makes it good is the tomato that should be eaten with each bite.

To wash it down, I ordered their tropical citrus iced tea! Of course I loved it!

I am a fan of Kim's menu offerings & I want to try the mahi fish, the goat cheese and beet salad, as well as lot of their other salads! The huli chicken looks really good too! We will definitely be back to try those!

Kim, the owner as well as everyone else who came around were very nice and welcoming! The food is yummy, and the setting is just what we love! The food is a fun healthy Hawaiian fusion fare which I definitely embrace!

They will also have a dog menu. Mocha Coconut loved the doggie tacos today!

She only said a few things at the start and I've been to her twice. But overall I would recommend going here!!! Great place with well trained stylists.",1
5638215,5,"This is a lovely little private plane airport and heliport. Free buddy brew coffee. Outdoor BBQ. Magazine offerings including Yacht charters. Private plane manuals and headsets. Views of downtown Tampa. What's not to like? Gas up and go. Drinking fountain too. They have it all.

Neat modern architecture on a small scale. Mostly prop planes. I'm not seeing any jets so I will have to park my Lear elsewhere.

Overlooking the runways they have nice tall aluminum bar stools and a couple benches. Beer can building and bank buildings in view.

I was just told they do get a couple of small jets passing through. Mine is definitely too big.",1

I will definitely go back for a regular meal soon!",1

2868619,5,"One word, delicious!   My boyfriend had the beef enchiladas and the short rib (!) was so tender and flavorful, it just melted in your mouth.  My baja tacos were made on their wonderful, homemade corn tortillas.  The chicken was spicy and savory, and the chopped pico on top had radish pieces that were just the right compliment to the other flavors.  It's so worth the trip up the hill to La Encantada.",1

5267821,5,"Fantastic food! We went here on the way to Atlanta and it absolutely hit the spot. We had Calvin as our server and he did a great job explaining hot pot to us and showing us how to order and what was best to order. You can order one combination (comes with the broth) and that should be enough for two people. We ended up adding a side of tofu, a side of beef, and udon noodles. I'd recommend ordering the rice noodles in the future, but that just may be person preference...the udon was almost too filling for me. If you aren't vegetarian, the beef is an amazing addition to the hot pot - otherwise the tofu was perfect! If you want delicious food, go here!",1
4101804,3,"More like 3 1/2 because they were early and the order came exactly as we'd requested.

After a long day out, we decided just to stay in at the hotel and order delivery. 

This place was one of the menus we looked at from the front desk. Although they seemed to specialize in pizza, we chose a couple other dinners. 

Each dinner came with a foil wrapped piece of garlic bread (just ok) and a side salad (exceptionally fresh) with our choice -- creamy Italian dressing. 

He got a meat lasagna -- it was okay. My chicken Francese was a large portion of chicken breast medallions in a lemony sauce. I thought with a touch of salt that it was much better than his lasagna. It was served with slices of lemon over a bed of penne pasta. 

Next time, if we order from then, I think I'd like to try their pizza which seems to have very good reviews on yelp.",1

I had the Thai chicken flat bread, which was amazing! And their mac & cheese is delicious ! The Pumpkin cheese cake, is a must !  SO Good!
The bartender was plentiful with the alcohol, so by drink number 2 i had to take it easy. Overall it was a pleasant experience and the service was great. 

I'm a fan!!",1
3813044,3,This place is really par. Nothing that really stands out on the menu or is unique/special. Sushi is tightly portioned. The rest of the menu is generic. There are better restaurants in the area with sushi/korean/japanese. Strongly advise you to skip coming here.,1
1010080,3,"Overall, not bad. While you wait you are offered a selection of refreshments. For your entertainment they are stocked with a variety of up-to-date magazines and a young Asian guy that you would swear was black if you closed your eyes.
The staff are diverse and polite however, some are inexperienced. They have a total of 7 workers and only 2 of that 7 know how to do acrylic nails. 1 of that 7 does eyebrows. The service is considerably slower than most salons however, i am not complaining about that. Just make sure you come when you do not have much to do.
The shop is cozy with not much waiting room seating. Overall it was not bad but my journey for a nail salon continues. I may come again.",1
4517664,5,I work at Nordstrom and love their coffee! Better than Starbucks - bigger servings for the same price if I am not mistaken. Their muffins are amazing! Cookies and scones can be rough if they're not super fresh. Also can't go wrong with a bagel! I recommend an iced caramel latte with almond milk and a sweet potato muffin!,1

It's the warm, down to earth staff who greet by name, take the time to get to know you, and are always cordial and polite; making Chinatown one of my favorite spots to visit in Philly. Ming, the chef and owner of New Harmony; has re-inspired my love for Chinese cuisine and I hope to be a lifelong guest at this cozy gem in arguably one of the most interesting neighborhoods in town.

I recommend the turnip cakes, and their mock-shrimp walnut dish. And of course the vegan pistachio ice cream.",1

I got a ¼ lb cheeseburger and adde bacon. One of the best burgers I've ever had. It tasted like someone had just grilled it for me at a bbq. And less than $10 with an upgraded side?! SIGN ME UP!

It either felt too pushy, too pawn shoppy, or too snooty.  The second we walked into Genovese it felt different.  It is a beautiful store with a large selection but you know they carry nothing but high quality.  We had the absolute pleasure of working with Tom.  He is amazing and made me feel like I was the only one in the world to ever buy from him.  You can tell he truly cares and genuinely wants to know your story and make you happy!

2277259,4,".I see some similarities here to the original Big Jud's on West Boise Avenue. Brushed metal tables, red naugahyde seats, great burgers and fries menu. What's missing here is the Wall Of Fame. That's where you could get your picture posted for completing the Big Jud's challenge in 30 minutes. Its not even advertised here. These walls and floors are nothing fancy.
.This is definitely a sit-down-and-pay-your-waiter establishment. There was a drive-through built for a previous business, but it seems to be now used for employee parking. Anyway, not much traffic comes through this quirky parking lot.
.The mushroom burger I had was delicious. They promote Double R Ranch Northwest Beef. It was cooked evenly through, but not blackened. Only wish that it came with tomatoes.
.Say, why do they advertise every sandwich on the menu as ""custom burgers"" while the kitchen and grill are out of sight? Any food joint could use this gimmick. Custom pancakes. Custom roast beef. Custom prime rib. Custom gyros. Yeah, right. Custom prices?",1
776677,5,"fw*88efkjsd3jwt5uj3owejdskjklj this place is goooooood.

I've only had one thing on the menu and it's one of the dishes  that I judge Korean restaurants by, kimchi jigae  It's basically a semi-spicy stew with kimchi, meat, and soft tofu.  The version here is quite possibly the best of the best in Nashville.  It's not overly spicy like other versions in town, but still has a kick.  The stew is chalk full of soft tofu, and it has a very faint taste of sesame oil.  What makes it is the thicker broth and the INCREDIBLY STINKY kimchi . Yeah, I said stinky.  If it's not stinky and funky, it's not good kimchi. 

The side dishes here are pretty solid.  We were served with a total of 6 sides.  The standout, of course, is the kimchi.  We also had what appeared to be seaweed or some sort of green veggie swimming in a very fishy sauce, it  tasted like sea water.  There was also sweet and sour squash, a very lightly dressed bok choy, bean sprouts, and something else that escapes me at the moment.

Don't except much from the place, you're going here for good Korean food, not for the ambiance and decor.  Don't be scared by the exterior, and definitely don't be scared by the nice old lady that serves and probably cooks the food also.  She speaks English and is super nice.  The inside is simple, the walls are bare, and there's not much else to look at.  

I'm told the kalbi (Korean short rib) is some of the best in town.  I'm sure I'll be back soon to work my way through the menu.  Stay tuned...",1
4841495,3,"I was really excited to try this place as my fiancé and I are running out of new places to try in SB. However this is a place where I feel like I tried everything I wanted to in one sitting and won't be needing to go back....

We came in on a Saturday night. It was pretty empty so we got seated right away. We were originally  put at a tiny two person table and when another group left, the waitresss  asked if we wanted to move to a bigger table, which was nice. Unfortunately, the rest of the night wasn't anything special. First, the waitress brought out lukewarm tap water, which actually had a gross tap water taste to it. I asked for ice water and that made it a little better. They didn't have soft drinks so that also was a bummer for me, but I know most  people don't care about that. 

We ordered appetizers- fried plantains and a salad and it took forever for them to bring it out. This was surprising bc it was so empty and the salad didn't have to be cooked- just thrown together.  We received the plantains first, but I think they forgot about the salad bc soon after our mains out and then the salad followed.

The food was decent. I did like my jerk chicken; the eggplant tower that my fiancé ordered was ehh. The arugula salad could have been better.

At the end, I had to chase down the waitress to give her our check which was also annoying considering it was slow and she was  just filling bottles with water. Overall It felt like the person who owns this place wasn't around and the waitresses didn't know how to prioritize their time. Glad I tried it, but probably won't be back.",1

Their tamales are good also!!!",1

The place is just filled with gift ideas if you're in need of a quick holiday gift (it looks like the knitting club has things selling there as well). 

The place can get really loud at night, so if you're going there to study your better be able to tolerate loud laughing or have noise cancelling headphones. 

Overall, I'm slowing working boba back into my diet. It's A-OK, Gabby Jay.",1

It's really like pecan picked, shelled, sugar melted, cooled and here ya go. Perfection. 

The store has a number of New Orleans goodies in there to purchase, too. Coffee, ice cream, other small trinkets and treats. 

Other candies are awesome as well. I've purchase fudge in many flavors and a Jackson Square more than once to tote with me. At times, it's even made it out the door!

They were just open for takeout and that's fine right now with me. It was just as she described. It came in a takeout container and didn't look very impressive.  I really didn't know what to expect. It was hands down one of the best tasting meals I've had in a long time. I will be reordering this at least 2-3  times a month! Vegetables were fresh, sauce was just a little sweet with a hint of coconut. Chicken was tender thin white meat. Take a leap and give it a try! I also provided a photo of the chicken and broccoli, so you traditionalists have something to look at.",1

The service here is always attentive (maybe to a fault) and they always seem to sit customers in a clump together vs spread over the smallish space.

In addition, if you spend $18 before tax you will automatically get a California roll! I had the salmon avocado roll and the fish tasted fresh and the rice was quite decently rolled. Definitely higher quality than the cheaper sushi restaurants I have tried, and so I would highly recommend to anyone craving a quick bite of sushi!",1

Excellent jukebox in the back and the strangest but fairly clean restrooms.  They're - well -campy.

Bartenders here are great.  This is a no stress hang out place in the heart of the French Quarter",1

I've never been a fan of sweets but I enjoy doughnuts here and there. These come out piping hot with a lot of powdered sugar and honestly I just don't think there's anything special about them.

The atmosphere is very modern, sleek, and like what you would expect from an upscale brewery. The location itself is huge and has multiple dining spaces as well as an outdoor area. We ordered cheese curds to start that we're amazing and we're served to the Buffalo ranch sauce that was also very tasty. for my entree, I ordered the pimento cheese grilled cheese with no pickles and a side of veggies. When they brought my order out, they forgot the side of pickles and accidentally brought me fries instead of vegetables but this can be expected as they've only been open for a few days. The server immediately went back to the kitchen and asked them to make me a new side of vegetables which were actually very tasty (I believe they were in some sort of soy sauce)! My husband ordered the seven oaks Burger that was topped with a delicious bacon onion jam as well as pulled pork and crispy onion straws! He loved it! They were pretty busy as it is a Saturday night and they just opened so I would say the service was a little slow but again nothing too crazy especially with them just opening on Monday!

I went for the Sesame Tofu Combination Platter (always a good deal) and my boyfriend ordered General Tso's chicken. The food was probably better-than-average, with flavorful sauces, and tender chicken/tofu.

5295363,4,"I saw this new restaurant pop up on Yelp so I decided to check it out.  You can guess the theme of the establishment based on the name.  In the same vein, I will attempt to describe the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of my experience (though I'll do it in reverse order).  Ordered the Spagetti and Ribeye for dinner and Cobbler and ice cream for dessert. 

First the Ugly, the place from the outside looks like some run down diner.  The signage is poor.  I passed it 3 times thinking that can't be it and the signage wasn't clear while driving by.  All I could see what ""Classic'.  I was looking for Spagetti or Steakhouse.  Oh it is there on the sign but not unless you are going slow taking your eyes off the road for too long of time to be safe.  I finally pulled in to check my phone and I accidentally was in the right place.

Next the Bad, the Spagetti was eh.  The noodles were too done for me.  They weren't mushy but they weren't al dente either.  The sauce was totally uninteresting as was the meatballs.  They meatballs were firm and had nice consistency but no real flavor.

Finally the Good, the Ribeye was great.  It was a large piece of meat cooked to perfection.  It was tender.  I really enjoyed it.  It made the meal!  It would be worth going back just for that.

Like most of my reviews, I comment about the service.  This place knows about service.  They were right on top of everything without being overbearing.  All of the servers were friendly without being overly friendly.

Though a bit pricey (Spagetti and Ribeye was $33), overall it was a good experience.  I would like to give it a try again and maybe try one of their other pasta dishes.",1

But this place is a great treat once in a while.  First, I like getting a glass of wine with lunch.  Second, the food is really good.  I like their broccoli rabe and sausage sandwich, their crabmeat monte cristo, and, especially, their lobster ravioli.  Good stuff.  The staff is also friendly, and the decor is really nice.",1
6506795,5,"Best meal I had in Florida.... Obviously they have a lot of lobster dishes.  They carry two types of lobster tails.  They also have an early bird special.  I didn't get in on that though.  They close at 9:00PM on Sundays and weekdays.  I had the Neptune platter.  It pretty much has a couple of everything... A couple gulf shrimp, mussels, fish pieces, plus a lobster tail.  You can also get lobster/filet mignon combos.  

It's a little pricey, but it is worth it.  The wait staff was great, there is valet parking and the food is excellent!  I highly recommend it if you are in the area.  

Between 2 of us, it was about $90 without any alcohol.  They do include an automatic 15% gratuity but we doubled that because of the great service.",1

1729110,3,"I bought a Living Social offer (slightly addicted) for GiGi and was so excited to try it.  The pics looked great and the menu looked amazing.  Turns out those slick copy writers represented GiGi as far more upscale than it is in real life. 

There was no air conditioning on the 90+ degree day that we went, so we opted to sit outside and get eaten alive bugs. The server was great, perky and friendly,  but she had to keep informing of of things not on the menu - we tried to order scallops, then mussels, and both were not available. The food we ordered was decent but not anything to write home (or write yelp) about.

I will say, however, the bartender made GREAT cocktails. The margartias we had with dinner were some of the best I've had, and the Pomengranate Mojitos at the end were a perfect ""dessert"" drink. 

Side note,  the bathroom was also a lil' icky, made more so by the overwhleming heat.  

If I were to return, it would be for happy hour, not dinner. I definitley couldn't justify the $$ with all the other amazing restaurants in the city.",1
631879,5,"I think I've found my new Sunday ritual! This cafe has been on my go-to list for some time, but I haven't made the time. Today, I finally did and had a lovely experience.

I began my visit with an order of White Peach iced tea with four pumps of simple syrup. The barista was pleasant and patient, making the ordering experience easy. My drink was prepared quickly and I sat down for four hours of catch-up work on one of their comfy couches by the window. The music they play here was a wonderful mix of study music, oldies, and instrumental - I loved it! The crowd comes and goes, but the white noise from conversations among the people is just enough to keep you focused without becoming distracting. 

I even posted a quick photo to my Instagram story and tagged them and they liked the photo almost immediately - social media activity is a huge plus for me!

I'll be back for more productive Sunday work catch-ups in the future!",1
6111045,5,"I chose Placer Appliance because of the excellent reviews online.    I made the appointment  for an oven repair with Kenny but someone else came out and did the work.  The work was done at a reasonable price.   However,  I was shocked when I came home from work to find the oven not re-installed correctly and a large gash in the drawer below the oven.   My wife reported to me that the repairman was set to leave without even commenting on the damage he had caused.    After she confronted him, he took a picture and told her he would report it to his boss.   Well,  he never did.   After not hearing anything back from the company, I called Kenny and he came out to see the damage.   He told me he had never heard a thing about the incident  from his employee.   He took the drawer, had it repaired and refinished.    He removed the oven, re-installed it correctly and left everything cleaner and better than it was before.  He also told me he fired the employee.   Wow!   I fully recommend Placer Appliance.    However, one caveat.  Use the phone, as my online and email attempts to contact Kenny were not successful at first.",1
4723211,4,"We decided to go here for restaurant week, and we were pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews. We got the mussels in white sauce, the eggplant rollatini, the pasta ""sampler"" that they gave, the veal Fontana, and the shrimp risotto. The gnocchi and and ravioli were delicious!! The veal portion was very small, and it was described as veal medallions, but came as cutlets. The risotto was a large portion, and was very tasty. The service was not bad--not over the top but nothing to really complain about either. I like that it is a byob. We sat outside in the newly created area. It's kind of scary with buses and cars driving fast literally right behind you, but at least we're able to eat out. We will definitely go back.",1
134333,5,"So this is a must go and you'll notice just by seeing the line outside! We were a group of 9 and everyone seemed to love their food and its such big portions that you could probably share with someone else.

I will go again on my next visit!",1

You can not go wrong with the Mac Daddy or Plain Jane tacos if your more traditional -- All delish ! . So excited to have this place in the neighborhood !

1210395,3,Food took 30-45 million years to come. Guests who were sat after us were given service first. The food came out cold. I was looking forward to this visit but it did not seem like much of an experience. It did not seem like the reviews correlated with the service or food flavor. I asked for scrambled eggs because I have a condition where I cannot have raw egg or meat and my order came out opposite of what I asked. BUT that BISCUIT. I will go back for a biscuit any day. 12/10 biscuit.,1

4891003,5,"Not sure what all the complaints are about.  The cost of the salad bar - same as everywhere else, including the Schnucks down the street.  

What I liked about it:

1. The bakery is great!  They actually make Napoleans with REAL whipped cream.  No fake 'whipped creme' here.  They have pretzel bread.  A really great variety.

2. The general variety of the store is good.  I love my Schnucks and shop there often.  But I do think the variety in this new Dierbergs is more.  There's more variety in the freezer section, in the fresh meats, and in the fresh fruit/vegetable section, that's for sure.

3. The layout is really nice and open.  It has a nice upscale feel.

4. Like Whole Foods, you can make your own peanut butter.  They also offer (HOORAY!) fresh squeezed orange juice.  You can't do that yourself, but they make it every day.  Love that.

5. I LOVE that you can park underground.  I like it when it's ridiculously hot and my car stays shaded and in the winter or rain when my car stays dry.  

6. While I didn't take the time to shop for gifts like the reviewer below, I did notice the health clinic.  I have someone in my family always needing a little something.  We often go to the Walgreens.  This looks like a lovely alternative.  I could actually get some things done while waiting.

Anyway, I love the new Dierbergs.  It's a great addition to West County.",1
4565985,4,"Clean grocery store with lots of selection and sales.

I feel like more and more grocery stores are embracing the Whole Foods model of offering a selection of warm, readymade food and an area where you can enjoy it. In my opinion, this adds a level of sophistication to the grocery store. This Safeway has jumped on that bandwagon. The food may not be the same hoity toity organic, au natural food as what you can find at Whole Foods, but they have a great variety and you definitely can make yourself a healthy meal. The tables are in the front of the Safeway by the cashiers. It isn't right next to the food selection, so don't worry if you don't see it at first glance - it exists.

They also have a cute little gourmet cookies area. There are platters of mini cookies in a display and you can mix and match for $9.99 a lb. How cute it that?

To me, it seems like everything is on sale - meat, cheese, oatmeal, cereal - it's a bit overwhelming. You feel like you're getting a great deal, but it makes me wonder if that means everything that isn't on sale isn't a low price. I literally feel like 75% of the store is on sale. It does succeed at making you walk out of the store feeling like a baller who shopped on the cheap!

They also have a surprisingly substantial organic section. It might not have all the healthy foods you are looking for, but I bet it has a majority of it. 

Another thing that stands out to me about this Safeway is they have cart wipes! No more worries about sticky fingers and germs. 

I found almost everything I needed (randomly they have 93% and 85% lean ground turkey, but not 99%) and even bought some I didn't, because, you know, sale. Overall, I think this is a great place to suit your grocery needs.",1
3463938,5,"Went to mai lee for the first time yesterday on a whim as we were nearby. I am soooo glad I stopped in. We were greeted immediately after walking through the door, asked if we were dining in or taking out. We chose takeout and were given a menu to order at the bar. As soon as we walked over to the bar we were greeted again and told to take our time, order when we were ready. With the pandemic, it meant so much to be acknowledged and told we could take our time and order when we were ready because so many places, due to no fault of their own, make you feel rushed. The service here, outstanding. We were given water, ordered a drink, and placed our food order. Within 10 minutes our order came out accurate and fresh! We opted for the chinese menu since it was our first time, wanting to ease in, but there are so many different options, from vietnamese to chinese, we will have to come back multiple times (which we are definitely excited to do) to try everything! I eventually finished my very gracious full glass of wine and went home to enjoy this meal! HOLY MOLY, it was good. What I appreciated most of all was that it was seasoned, not greasy at all, and so flavorful. The crab rangoon, the low neon, the chicken, the shrimp, everything was fantastic.  I added soy and hot chili sauce because that is my preference but my boyfriend enjoyed his dishes with no additions. Get an egg roll and try mai lee!",1
2513935,4,"Super cute little place. I found it while wandering around looking at some of the incredible sculptures on their block.

While I can't speak to the chocolate, it smelled heavenly. 

I stopped in for breakfast and grabbed a Bacon, Egg and Cheese Sandwich on a Croissant ($6.49) and a Medium Cappuccino ($4.50).

The Croissant was flaky and delicious with a good sized serving of Egg, plenty of Cheese and a few strips of crispy Bacon. Fresh, hot and well made. The Cappuccino wasn't anything fancy - but it was strong and freshly made. 

They offer ice cream, pastry, handmade chocolates and bags of candy and popcorn. The staff was friendly and they offer a good bit of beating both indoors and outside.",1

Since this is a family style restaurant, we sat at a table for 12.  Soon we were joined by 3 other couples and the food and conversation began to flow.  We were served fried chicken, fried catfish, bbq ribs, stuffed shells, broccoli salad, cole slaw, collard greens, white beans, corn bread, green beans, escalloped corn, banana pudding, and probably a couple more dishes I overlooked.  Every single dish was perfect!  The staff was friendly and attentive.  We will definitely return the next time we're in Nashville!  Loved it!!",1

They're usually very good, and if you don't like them, just take them back.",1
4983608,3,Stepped in for just donuts.  The place is really uniquely designed and artsy. I liked the vibe. My friend and i tried the keylime and smores. For 3 to 4 dollar donuts... i didn't think it was worth it. Neither of the donuts were that nice soft texture.  It must have been sitting out for a little while.  The keylime cream was too sweet for me and overwhelming.  The smores was interesting with chocolate and marshmallows on top. I thought that one was better but again... it just want all that special. They looked beautifully made but they tasted just okay.  Ive had better donuts. Their menu however looks very interesting with cereal and grilled cheese sandwiches... maybe others can vouch for those selections with better reviews.,1

When we ate there, they were out of chicken wings app?? Who runs out of chicken wings, it was  little surprising.

We go regularly for the seitan steak tip appetizer and seitan fajitas.  The chips and salsa are dangerously good, and the tofu salad is nice for an occasional switch-up.

The seitan ""wings"" are good if you can eat super-spicy food.

We're regulars for dinner and had a great time having a party at Adobe this past fall.  They have private rooms for parties from 35 - gigantic.

3429775,4,"OK, so none of the guys are really there, but their kitchen magic is ever present. I've been a fan for years...a fan of the food and its consistency. I've found the Cool Springs location solid for quality and cleanliness. Yes, it's a franchise and your mileage will vary place-to-place...except (IMNSHO) for the food.

COVID-19's indelible stain is there today in the form of masks, no self-service peanuts or condiments, half-capacity seating, and the awkwardness of finding an available ""twiddle nervous thumbs here"" floor decal as you hope to avoid the occasional irresponsibility of a mask-free customer. (To avoid dealing with such miscreants, the Guys also waive delivery fees during this difficult time.)

The food? If you want a no-frills burger for something to get in your belly, visit a dollar menu at any of the ""all-beef"" or ""impossible"" patty competitors. If you want a full-flavored, fully-cooked, piled with fresh ingredients meal that sticks to your ribs for hours...this is the place for ""regular"" (too much) and ""little"" (right-sized) burger excellence and the best fries on the block. Cost? You'll pay part of the franchise fee with every order, though it's hands-down better than similarly-to-higher priced hipster semi-gourmet competition. The ""little"" burger can also be eaten without need of sundry utensils or chasing ingredients all over your lap.

Here's my can't-go-wrong solution for the problem of ordering too much food: Little Bacon Cheeseburger All-The-Way with BBQ sauce, regular-sized dump of fries (that will feed three people,) and a soft drink (free refills.)",1

874387,5,"Sump is pretty great. I had heard rave reviews from a friend in St. Louis - their take was that even though it seemed unreasonably expensive at first glance, Scott, the proprietor, was so passionate about coffee, and made it so well, that you'd come back for more anyway. Yes, it's $5 for a pour over or $3.50 for an espresso. Yes, the vibe isn't the most charming. But let's give it the benefit of the doubt for a minute - it's in an industrial park that was built from the ground up in the last year. Give it a few years, and there might be some more trees around. 

In the meanwhile, one thing is for certain - the coffee is really, really good. Probably the best pour over I've had in Nashville. The baristas were friendly and unpretentious. They clearly care about coffee, but aren't going to stare you down if you wandered in looking for a meal. They'll simply direct you next door to Pastaria, or offer you a pastry (spent a few hours there; actually witnessed this happen). 

They had 4 pour over options during my visit, all brewed with a v60 brewer - a Sumatra Kerinci, Ethiopia Chelbessa, Costa Rica Las Lajas, and an Ecuador La Merced. I opted for the Sumatra, which was surprisingly delicate and a little spicy - a credit to the roaster. I also purchased a 12oz bag of the Ecuador La Merced ($17), so stay tuned for the results of that one. The espresso of the day was the Ethiopian Chelbessa as well. 

I enjoyed Sump's focus on coffee, and really little else. I found it easy to sit and enjoy the coffee and work in the space without distraction. And most of all, the coffee itself was A+. I'll likely be back many, many times.",1

I love this place. It has everything you could want. I had to start with a beer flight since I enjoy trying new things.   I chose Turtle Red Ale, Brown Lager, Maple Bacon Stout, and Rodbender Red Ale. I liked them all. I then ordered the Beach Blonde Ale. It was my favorite. 

We started with guacamole and queso with chips. They have specials and I love trying specials so that's what I ordered. It was a Cheeseburger Quesadilla. It was delicious. 

There was so much to do here. There is a game room, a big area full of board games, and outdoor games. We will have to come back on our next visit when we have more time to play.",1
6706741,5,"This is a great restaurant in the French Quarter. It used to be in a different location so this is the first time we've dined here since it moved. The atmosphere is a little different just because everything seems so ""new"" compared to the ""lived in"" look of the old place but it's still very nice.

It's definitely more upscale than most places in the Quarter and while there isn't really a dress code (although you can't wear a hat) you might feel under dressed if you stumble in here in your bar hopping garb. 

The food, which is sort of modern Italian, was as excellent as it's always been and everyone in our party really enjoyed their meal. The service was efficient and friendly. 

The bottom line: if you are looking for a more upscale dining experience in the French Quarter with really good food then Irene's is the place for you.",1

Overall a cool ambiance and fantastic drink spot, though I think the music could be much better curated to match the feel of the place.

This is not a place for babies but mature adults that want to enjoy a leisurely paced meal and be able to hear your dinner companion talk.  Yes, we will go back.",1

5830596,4,"Did carry out on national pizza day! We had the cauliflower pizza crust pizza. One half California Cobb and the other half roasted garlic chicken. The crust was great, the roasted garlic chicken was also awesome. The California Cobb was too salty and had too much lettuce. We also got a salad and appetizer that were both good too. The appetizer was a pepper dish which was very spicy hot. Will be having the cauliflower crust again",1
4425717,4,"Cute brunch spot! Food was good, 4 stars.  We got the Skillet #1, potatoes were al dente,  not my personal preference, but it is my husband's, good thing because that's what he ordered. I had the chorizo con huevo, it was simple & tasted good.  Waitress forgot a few things, service was average maybe a 3.5 to 4, nice, pleasant, she helped me check in to get our free 1/2 order of sunny puffs, just not the super happy friendly service I expected from the reviews. The puffs though! Delish! Our kid loved the Mickey Mouse pancakes (a little rubbery, she didn't mind it at all), and loved the sausage and the fun beachy tropical theme. I always appreciate a good cup of Coffee.",1
6552723,4,"This place has the most ""loca"" feel I've experienced of any restaurant I've been to in a while during travel.  Will it make you feel slightly out of place and uncomfortable at first?  Sure, but it's worth it.

Tried this place out because of the ridiculous prices at the JW up the street, and there really wasn't another decently reviewed restaurant for a couple miles.

The bartender was friendly enough, food options were minimal, but that's a good thing because it seemed like whatever you chose, you can't go wrong.  Got the half rack of ribs, way better than you'll ever get at a chain restaurant.  You get a salad, baked potato and all you can eat bread and beans.  Margaritas were good, too!",1
493923,4,"I was really impressed with Chickie Wah Wah. I went for a UYE to grab some Taceaux Loceaux from the kitchen and enjoy some bluegrass. I've reviewed the taceauxs before (DELICIOUS) but didn't talk much about the venue itself. It's nice to have a non-smoking venue and the two times I've been there the live music was pretty good if not something I typically listen to. I'd spend more time there but I prefer to hear my companions when we're talking, which isn't always possible since there's a live band playing. The bartender was nice and they have a good selection of drinks. It's really the Taceaux Loceaux that will keep me coming back, but for a bar it's really nice.

PS, it's worth noting that the men's room was spotless. That kind of thing goes a long way when we're talking about a music venue.",1

4759177,4,"We went to Cantina Feliz on Friday Jan 4. Make sure to make a reservation. It was a busy at 6 when we arrived for our reservation. 

M to F they have happy hour specials from 430 to 630. The margaritas here are outstanding! And they serve out of a tap! I asked the bartender about it and he said they fresh squeeze lime juice and put the margaritas in a mini keg and pressurize. Did mention how good the margaritas are? Delicious!

My wife and shared a few items : traditional Guacamole, spicy tomato ceviche,  carnitas as well as the Tres Leche dessert. Food tasted really good!

Service by our waitress and the table support staff were prompt and courteous. 

If you enjoy Mexican food, definitely try this place out there is a lot of choices. Our meal suggests the rest of the menu is equally as good.",1
3049003,5,"Best childcare option in town! Their nannies are reliable and trustworthy. The office staff is very knowledgeable, as well as the owner. We were very happy with this service and will continue to use them!",1
2230873,5,"Owned by a very lovely young couple. Every once in a while they will bring their little boy in! But of course, what you're wondering about is the food so I'll get to that.

They serve Chinese, Hibachi, and Japanese. Everything is very moderately priced. They have really great specials each night for sushi and hibachi too. If you are looking for a meal with a big portion that isn't too hard on your wallet then this is the place to go.

The quality is also very good and fresh. I have never had a problem with their food, and I know that they are very quick to solve any problems. If you don't like a dish, send it back and no questions asked. 

Their Chinese is great!. You can customize (add any vegetable, sauce, spicyness) which really makes it stand out. If you don't like a particular aprt of the dish you can swap it out for something else.  They have very generous portions and  you will not leave hungry! Literally add anything you want, maybe a side of bok choy or maybe some jumbo shrimp in your meal, all for a very fair price. They are very accommodating to allergies and preferences (gluten, fish, eggs, MSG...anything!) and will happily clarify anything on the menu for you. The menu they have online does not do it justice! They have tons of specials and additions to their menu you will only find by stopping by the restaurant.

I have found the staff to be very welcoming, polite, and knowledgeable. The general atmosphere is very nice. It's very open and there is plenty of seating in the ""chinese side"", with candles and nice lighting. There is also a sushi bar in the back you can sit at which is great. There is plenty of space between the tables so you don't feel cramped even when it's busy.  The hibachi section is new-ish (opened in the past few years) and very well modeled. Also tons of fun! The chef really puts on a great show! The food and the fun makes the hibachi a great choice for large parties ( you can order Chinese and Japanese food too if you are sitting on the hibachi side!)

Overall I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars. It's fantastic for anyone just coming in town for a day, and the locals who have been eating regularly here for 5 years. The food is fantastic, varied, and very customizable and the staff is great. Not to mention coming here is supporting a local small business, not a chain, and they really give great customer service because of that. I am a huge fan of Jasmines and I will be coming back many many times in the future.",1

2884952,5,"Having danced at a very serious studio when I was young, and then quit because it was too much pressure, I've always been looking for a studio where you can feel part of the community without committing to 17 hours a week, where you can take classes very intensely or just for fun, where every dance style is open and encouraged...and in Tucson, I found the place! Breakout Studios is great!

They cater to every age group, and I've never felt out of place in a class, even when the people in it ranged from 7 to 65. They're so welcoming, and they have great deals on living social sometimes (watch for them!). I particularly recommend Jazz Funk as a great workout/dance class if you have some dance background, or any class that Todd teaches. He's a great teacher, as well as owner/manager/etc: he creates the perfect environment for a studio. 

I can't say enough good things, just try it!",1
2870195,4,"Didn't expect to like Butcher Burger but after a bad experience a few days earlier in the area I thought I would give them a try.  While basically decor-wise it's just a modified Char-lee's with (hopefully) new owners inside I definitely though there was a difference in the food quality and cleanliness.  The menu has a Mediterranean twist on it which is appealing to me.  Greek salads are offered and Mediterranean burgers as well.  I went for the normal bacon cheeseburger, fries and soda.  The bacon was cooked well.  The burger had great texture and was very full flavored, not bloody and not overcooked.  These guys make a good burger here.  The fries were shore fries (fresh cut skin on them)  lots of vinegar around to use there or take with you.  They were fresh fried and really excellent.  Good quality, fresh ingredients it seemed.  Wasn't fond of the fresh cut beef display window as I am not sure why it was there though the product quality of the raw hamburger meat in there appeared to be exceptional.  I hope this burger joint does better than Char-lee's did in that spot.  I really was pretty impressed and would go back again.  They just need a vanilla syrup and cherry syrup based fountain soda to add to your sodas to make it real fountain style.  That would make all the difference in the world to me.  Nothing beat a real cherry syrupy coke with a great burger and shore cut fries.  Didn't get to try the milkshakes or hot dogs. Will update if and when I do.",1

2295327,4,"First time at J.Alexander's as of yesterday.  I had heard this place had a pretty good rep. for quality, quantity, and excellence in general.  We were greeted by a more than pleasant hostess and quickly lead to huge table that was half-booth, half-table, very unique.  The lighting was just right and the service was pretty much impeccable.  I ordered a Honeysuckle sparkling wine type of drink and although a little strong for my taste, it was still satisfying and less expensive than I would have guessed.  The spinach queso dip was delicious for an appetizer, not too heavy or creamy.  I ordered the Steak Maui and Smashed..now I am not typically a huge steak fan, but the sauce on this steak created a succulent masterpiece and what I like to refer to as a ""mouth-gasm"" (orgasm of the mouth).  The steak was cooked just right and the potatoes delicious as well.  Last but not least, a good list of desserts to choose from..now the crew I was with were feeling a little too shy for dessert, but not this gal.  I ordered up the Creme Brulee..and this is a tough dish to master, but this dessert was PERFECTION..so creamy and perfectly sugared and hardened on top..with a warm outer and cool inner.  Once my friends got a glimpse of this bowl of heaven, they too partook in it.  Big portion and the best part of my night.  I would definitely return for not only the service, ambiance, and entrees..but also, the dessert!:)",1

I wouldn't be able to tell you my favorite dog yet, as I've only gotten through half their menu. I like that there is a veggie dog option and a gluten free bun option. The buns in general though, are just terrible. They're just too dry! But the fries are great - thin and crispy. There's almost as many options for dipping sauces as there are hotdogs.

5648079,4,"""Project Pie"" is sort of pioneering the food industry's fast casual concept within the realm of pizza making with this growing chain of affordable artisan pizza restaurants that got its start in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand and has already grown to include the international market including multiple locations in the Philippines and other locations including the U.K. Still a relatively small chain, Project Pie has the slogan of ""Everyday Artisan Pizza - Custom-built by You"" and that tells you pretty much what to expect. 

This location, the first in Indiana, is in a 3-storefront strip center that was recently built in front of the Meijer at 96th and I-69. It's a modestly sized location, though they offer a few outdoor dining tables and the dining room itself is a fairly open concept with sort of an industrial-lite feeling and a fun spirit. It's hard not to notice the graffiti-laden wall to your right as you enter that is filled with a variety of inspirational and sort of self-awareness quotes from the likes of everyone from Ralph Waldo Emerson to Ed Sheeran. It's awesomely weird. 

The strip center has actual ADA accessible parking spots (Yay!) and appropriate curb cuts. The glass front door is pretty workable. Once you enter, you see a sign that instantly describes how to order - You can basically order one of their usual pizzas, numbered from 1-8, and including the option of gluten-free crust OR they have a customize your own option for $7.95. They also serve salads and other good s#*! (and yes, they actually have ""good s#*!"" on their menu!). It made me smile. They serve up Boylan Sodas as their fountain soft drinks along with Brisk Unsweetened Iced Tea (So, yeah, I was happy). Boylan sodas tend to be healthier without preservatives and additives and utilizing pure cane sugar. Perfectly healthy? Nope, but definitely a better option than the mass-market garbage. 

While I usually customize due to my own finicky nature, I actually ordered a #2 that included Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Crumbled Meatballs, Mozzarella, our signature red sauce, garlic. You do have customizing ability with these, but I decided to try theirs. These are cooked up in a massive clay oven at 600 degrees - it takes usually 2-4 minutes was my observation. Yet, you unquestionably get the brick-fired pizza taste. It's worth noting that they all come in one size and I had no problem finishing off one myself (but hadn't eaten all day). They typically slice them into four slices, though they actually asked me if I wanted eighths and I did go with that option. 

The employees were friendly and helpful, though not in a condescending manner. Most of the tables work pretty well with a wheelchair and they are spaced well enough that you shouldn't have any danger of getting blocked in. While no one actually moved a chair, their chairs were light and I had no problem arranging my table. I also had no doubt that someone would have done so had I struggled - They did actually bring my pizza to me, though I think their routine is that you actually pick it up yourself. 

If you have had brick-fired pizzas, then you know kind of what to expect. The crust is light, slightly crispy and differently textured throughout the pie. There might be some burn spots, but that's part of the flavor and I love it. It's not really thin crust and it's definitely not anything close to pan...I'd say it's slightly thicker than traditional thin-crust, though that can also depend on the toppings used. 

I really enjoyed the pizza. I'm not quite willing to call it the best of Indy, but there's no question that if you're not wanting to wait the 17 hours needed for Giordano's that you can grab a quick meal before catching a flick at the nearby movie theater and have time to spare. While i like the brisk iced tea, I will admit that given they use Boylan for their sodas it would be kind of nice if they'd find a more indie iced tea than the Pepsi/Lipton partnership that produces Brisk. 

For right about a ten spot, maybe slightly more, you get a positive and energetic atmosphere with a really good pizza and a fun wall that should keep you reading for a while. Be aware that they don't really have side options other than salads and a couple other things, so if you're hoping to snag some other sides you'll be a touch disappointed. However, ""Project Pie"" is a solid entry into the Indy pizza scene and a great option for those wanting a quick meal without compromising quality.",1

Our server was a nice lady, but she was sooooooo slow.  It took over 10 minutes to even get waters, and we had to hunt her down to order.  We were starving and not happy about this, but her sweetness made us tone down any annoyance.

I ordered the seared ahi entree and the hubby ordered the catfish sandwich.
My ahi was cooked nicely.  It was not a bad piece of fish.  I liked the greens that it was served with, but it was literally less than a handful of greens.  This is the strange part: my ahi was served with an eggplant tomato base and a piece of bread with olive tapenade.  Separately, everything was pretty tasty.  All together, it was the oddest combination.  I separated out the meal in order to enjoy it.  I applaud the chef for trying to be creative, but the subtleness of the seared ahi was overpowered by the tomato and eggplant base.  The dish was trying to hard to be Mediterranean, but the components did not go together.

The hubby had the catfish sandwich.  It was good, but nothing special.  The coleslaw on it was very bland.  The fries were fine. 
 
Our total came to $60 for the above mentioned meals.  Not worth it.  But considering that my huevos rancheros and a latte from room service cost $29, this meal doesn't look too badly priced.

The food was good enough, it just wasn't as good as one would hope for the ambience and the price.  I think the 1 star reviews are a bit low for this place, but this is certainly not somewhere one needs to eat.  There are better alternatives for the money.",1

4201888,4,"My family and friends had dinner here a couple of nights ago. We started with grouper bites, onion rings and pulled pork nachos. The grouper and onion rings were spot on, hot, well prepared and well seasoned. I was intrigued at the nachos. Everyone enjoyed them. I did as well. Good flavor and good chips. I would have liked to see a little more layering of the ingredients. They were kind of poured on top of a pile of chips. It was difficult to disassemble and eat. I also prefer melted cheese instead of cheese sauce.

The main courses were fantastic. I think everyone got either Mahi Mahi or grouper sandwiches. I had a Caribbean (jerked) grouper sandwich. The fish was cooked perfectly, the sauce was very nice, not too hot. All in all a good experience. I only rated a 4 because I don't think we stretched them too much. We ordered their stand by staples. If I had gone to the raw bar and they delivered then maybe but it is what it is. A good casual seafood place. If that's what you want, you won't be disappointed.

the hotel is fairly nice. the lobby is all for show. the pool doesn't excite me. dull and dirty looking area, i've never used it. i use the fitness room all the time, pretty small and only room for 3 or 4 people at most.

the staff...eh. they don't seem excited to be working here at all, and in times like these they should be happy to have a job. you will not be greeted with a HELLO!!!! when you arrive. the room service mumbles ""how are you this evening"" like it's out of a script.

the parking and wifi is ridiculous. the rate at face value is as well. i've seen rooms going for $200 a night.

if you can pay $125 and get free wifi and parking it's a good deal.

overall i'm not that pleased, but i like being within walking distance of shaw park (ice skating in winter!), a BUNCH of restaurants, and a quick drive to target, walgreens or the mall if i've forgotten something.

not a magical place for weddings but i see them every time i'm here. not a romantic place either. it's in the business district for a reason. lots of suits and blackberries stay here.",1
6916878,3,"A nice little pizza place that a couple other restaurants in Philadelphia just do better.  It's spacious, the pizza is fine, the service is good, but it does nothing great.  

Porta is part of a large group of restaurants that is speckled between Asbury Park, NJ, Burlington City, NJ and Philadelphia.  As a group, they're all fine establishments that are professionally run, growing more comfortable with the locals and serviced well.  It's price point ranges from a more working-class Brickwall to...the upscale(ish) Porta.  

The Good:

Let's start with the service, which I never do, but it was very good.  All servers were attentive in the 3 times I've been here (twice for functions, once for dinner). Bartenders worked fast, diligent and were very easy to get a hold of, even in a fast-moving bar setting.  Sometimes service is marked by a special moment or interaction that made you realize, they were really trying.  Porta hasn't had that for me, but that's it's own sign, because I also didn't notice anything bad.  Just all around good work and a well managed restaurant.  

The pizza is fine and even good.  In a similar artisan style to other shops like Pizzeria Vetri or Nomad.  The problem is, those places just do it better.  Everything tasted a little more mass produced and corporate.  It was fine, it was more that edible, but the menu didn't have the wow factor.  Moreover, the prices were just a hair ($1-2 dollars) more expensive than competitors - for what reason, I do not know.  

I will say, the bread and appetizer meatballs were excellent, my wife and I fought over the third meatball.  But the rest was average.  That's not to say bad at all, but nothing really stood out to us.

I will say, as far as Center City/Gayborhood Happy hours go, Porta's is pretty solid for a less ""Bar"" happy hour event.  $4 Beers, $5 Wines and $6 cocktails (which were well made!) is nothing to turn your nose at in this neighborhood and this may be what's worth returning for!

The Bad:

Much like I don't have anything overly positive to say, I have limited negatives.  This place checks all the boxes, but doesn't seem to do anything very, very, well.  You won't leave Porta disappointed, you won't be upset you came, but you may not be able to justify returning to a place in a City with so many other great options.

We may return for Happy Hour soon, but it's just a hard place to justify for a dinner, even a pizza dinner!",1

6556019,5,"I heard that I needed to stop by here during Philadelphia Beer Week and boy did this place not disappoint. I was able to get both Pliny the Elder and Blind Pig in one place. For a beer geek, this place is heaven.

The service here is fantastic. I turned away for a second while sitting at the bar and without even asking for more water, the bartender had reached over with the water gun and filled up my glass. Now that's service!

Most importantly, co-owner Tom Peters just an amazing guy. I randomly got into a conversation with him and then eventually learned I was speaking to the owner. We geeked out on beer for quite a while and he was nice enough to buy me a beer. If you get the chance, introduce yourself and say Hi because he really is a great person to talk to and has played such an important role for the beer community in Philadelphia and on the East Coast.",1

6204182,5,"Wegmans is a great grocery store.  I always enjoy shopping here.  It's huge, clean, well-stocked, produce fresh, fresh and great variety of cuts of meat, and literally you can find almost anything your heart desires in this store.  Their specialty sections are great, too, especially the bakery and deli. 

I have shopped in different Wegmans in different states.  They all seem to have the same extensive array of products.  Prices may be a bit higher than some discount grocery stores, but for the most part they are comparable to any other grocery stores.  If you choose to purchase their store-brand items, you can save some money.

They used to operate café pre-COVID-19 time, but it's on hold now.  I'd imagine with the current loosening of restrictions, they will be back relatively soon. 

Great shopping experience.",1

427243,3,"Go for the subs and sandwiches; they're excellent and big.  Depending on your tastes, you may want to skip the baked goods section.  

The first time we went, while our subs were being made, we picked up a slice of what was labeled ""banana bread"" (although we'd never seen banana bread that looked like this) and an oatmeal cookie.  Never again.  The banana bread reminded me of the hard, dark breads that my mom would pick up every Christmas; the ones that we had to slather with cream cheese to give them any moisture and make them chewable.  This piece was dense, didn't really have any smell (certainly not a ""banana bread"" smell), and there was no discernable evidence of a banana being anywhere in the kitchen when this was baked.  It was uniformly dark brown, with none of the usual banana flecks.

The oatmeal cookie was huge and looked delicious, but instead of allowing the natural sweetness of oatmeal to be highlighted with just a minimum of sugar, this cookie clobbered you with sweetness that seemed like a molasses flavor.  There was so much sweetening happening here, that it was crystallized on the cookie!

Speaking of sweetening where it's not needed, we eagerly awaited the beginning of ""chili season"", and when it finally arrived, we got ourselves over to Italian Kitchen for a bowl.  I nearly gagged on the first spoonful from the over-sweetening.  This must be some modified ""east coast chili"" recipe, because real western chili has little or no sugar, and definitely not enough that it's the first thing you taste.  It was, like, sugar soup with an undertone of beans and tomatoes.  I ate a couple more bites and threw the rest away.

They have a good assortment of chips and a ""Quickie Mart"" section where you can pick up butter, milk, orange juice, or something from their wide assortment of soft drinks and fruit juice.  There's a small eat-in area in the front, and parking seems ample.  When it gets crowded, someone comes out to the front and starts taking orders without waiting for the customer to get to the counter.  That's considerate, and really moves things along.

I'll try their salads, at some point; salads are hard to wreck.  I had been hoping to try a pizza, too, but wonder if they over-sweeten the pizza sauce, same as the chili.  I'd rather drive to Woodstown for pizza that we already know is delicious than take a chance on a pizza that we can't eat.  Maybe they'll let us taste a sample first.

Hubby is quite taken with the place, so we'll be back often, but we'll be sticking mostly with subs and chips.",1

1202942,5,"Facility is stunning but the doctors are even better. They have cutting-edge knowledge and spend so much time on you. Prior to Palm, I saw many doctors with no answers, no diagnosis or progress. Not that I was hoping for a diagnosis, but I had many uncomfortable symptoms for years and no idea why. They have been able to identify issues that no other doctors even thought to test for, and I can't tell you how much better they have me feeling. All of the doctors have different specialties (rheumatology, internal medicine, dermatology, chiropractic etc.) so you can see one or multiple depending on your needs, but they all communicate with each other to get you on the best plan for wellness. I personally think it's expensive but it's all inclusive for the most part and they basically teach you how to heal yourself over time. They helped me understand what is actually causing the issues and how to read my own lab results to check for progress or regression. So, I really just consider the cost a small investment to understanding my own health and having a future where I don't develop autoimmune disease, cancer or feel like crap everyday. They also offer so many other amenities (gym, spas, salt room, If I went on about how wonderful their facility is, this would be too long. The long story short, they have saved my health.

3769547,3,"I've discovered the secret of enjoying the country bar. And it's not to start enjoying country music... although, not hating SOME country music is kind of the place to start from.

I was in E-town for a friend's bday. Her choice of music venues, Cook County. I haven't been to CC since my Uni days (and in those days I was a lot less relaxed about blurring the lines between my musical tastes. Country was most certainly not on my list of things to be listening to). 

Anyway, once you've established at least a tolerance for some of the songs, the way to enjoying a country bar is to go with a lot of friends, have at least one other friend who is also not drinking a lot (you could argue that drinks are necessary... but then you need to be willing to drink alcohol of qualities I'm much less likely to consume these days at a rather inflated price), show up before 10 pm so you won't be complaining about a cover charge (birthday packages help), be at a bar with a mechanical bull you can watch people ride (or try out for yourself), do the Cadillac Ranch, and then head out the door by 1215. 

See, this way you get the fun songs, you do the cheesy dances, you get to watch others around you starting be sufficiently ""happy,"" leave before it all gets old and feel great the next morning when you meet everyone else for breakfast!

4133484,5,"Being short on time we wanted to experience multiple exhibits without going to multiple museums. We are so happy we made this decision. We bought our tickets ahead of time, but the museum was not that busy so I highly doubt you couldn't buy them right there. We spent about $50 for two tickets, which was not bad considering we opted out of going to multiple for just this one. When we arrived the experience starts with a little short film, about 5 minutes and it talks a little bit about the history of the museum than the rest of the tour is self-guided.

There is a section within the museum that is dedicated to Grammy's and you can actually go and perform on drum sets, sing, or a piano if that is something you are into. They provide wipes and hand sanitizer around the whole section too, which I really appreciated. 

The most interesting thing about this museum is that it truly hones in on the artists behind those mainstream acts, so the bands that played on records. In addition, there was so many exhibits what had real artifacts of some big name artists such as Elton John, Michael Jackson, and Ringo Starr. There is a whole separate little walk through exhibit dedicated to Jimi Hendrix, which we really enjoyed. 

My partner's favorite part and one of the biggest reasons we went is that they have a whole room dedicated to Johnny Cash. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and recommend to anyone who may not be 100% on country music or 100% on one specific artist!",1

I had a steak, it was cooked as requested, but it was tough and not flavorful.

1820508,4,"Finally got to try a Phil A Mignon steak sandwich last night.  My Bro and Bud placed a to go order for 3 steaks and 24 of the raspberry peppercorn wings.  Originally, we were going to order the regular steaks which are roughly 7 bucks...But decided to upgrade to the Filet Steak sandwich which are roughly $15.  3 Filet Steak sandwiches and 24 wings came out to roughly 70$.  They were nice and added a free 2 liter of coke to the order, which is warranted IMHO.  Anyone orders 3 sandwiches and wings for 70 bucks they should get something comped!

As excited we were to try the steaks, we were all quick to get into the wings.  Not a common flavor for wings...They were fantastic! On the larger size, crispy and delicious!  We only wished there was more sauce!  Next time we may order some on the side as well.  The problem with 24 wings in a container is that only the bottom layer soak up the sauce...so we did a lot of sloshing the container around and dragging our wings thru it to sop it up...Definitely give these a shot, well worth trying this ""exotic"" wing sauce.

Onto the Filet Steaks...First look...what a waste of a filet...It was well done and there wasn't that much of it for starters...the ends of my roll both lacked steak...I wondered if it was because we ordered 3 steaks and they didn't put enough meat on the grill for 3 sandwiches, but made it work anyway...the steak was thin cut, about 3/8 of an inch thick...Just seemed like there should have been more on there for my 15+ dollar sandwich...

The roll itself was fantastic...a seeded long roll, my guess is from Sarcone's.  I think the regular steaks come on non seeded rolls as the menu says ""seeded rolls add 1.00 for regular steaks"".  Nice that the rolls didn't dominate the sandwich, not too much bread, except for the ends of the roll where the steak didn't reach.  

Taste...It was good.  It did not knock my socks off by any means and I won't be rushing out to get another.  I'm actually more excited to try their regular steaks now.  I really didn't notice the ""bourbon glaze"" marinade, nor did my guests...maybe if you had it plain without a roll, cheese and onions you could taste it but we didn't notice it on our sandwiches.  I read somewhere they marinate overnight but it didn't seem that way to us!  

I do have a tip for you all, and the business.  They should be putting the raspberry peppercorn sauce on the filet steak sandwiches!  We dipped our steaks in the sauce and it was KILLER.  That marinade we could taste and it works so well with the filet!  Try it!

So, a bit letdown with the signature Filet Steak sandwiches, but the wings and sauce rocked our world and we will definitely be back to try the regular steaks and some of the other offerings they have here.  

We collectively decided if we were to order again we would order 1 filet steak to split and regular steaks all around...Just a bit too pricey for what you are getting IMHO.",1
2665938,4,"Why 4 stars?  It's the best grocery store for everything but groceries.

   ---   ---   ---

It'd be like if the iPhone 5 was able to teleport matter over FaceTime, drive your car and go to the gym for you....but it struggled to make calls.

Publix Greenwise has everything under the sun; a hot food buffet, salad bar, gelato counter, full sandwich bar, an extensive bakery, pasta bar, an in-house event planner (!), a sushi chef, 4x the normal amount of steak/chicken/beef (including Kobe Beef) and more cheese than you could fit into the entire city of Seminole.

What holds Publix Greenwise back is that it's not a practical place for doing your actual grocery shopping.  Because most products in here are organic/green, it's impossible to find all of your normal supplies that you'd get from a regular Publix.

I had a Garlic Steak Sandwich with Mac-n-Cheese during my last visit.  It was surprisingly not great.  That being said, I would absolutely go back for lunch or dinner again because there is a vast selection of choices.

What's not to like about riding down an escalator to get into a grocery store?  I think that, and the part of the escalator that's just for shopping carts, is worth 3 stars alone.",1

Since it was my first time, I got a signature pizza, with my choice being the BBQ chicken, in which I added some roasted garlic too. It was deeeelicious! I took the recommendation of my very friendly pizza maker and had it cooked to extra crispy, which I loved :) 

Another thing that I REALLY LIKED, their SMORES! Holy moly they are so good! They take the cookie sandwich with marshmallow and chocolate nestled in between graham cracker cookie and melt it to perfection right in their blazin oven, where it comes out to ooey gooey goodness, warm and ready to eat... Mmmmm. 

What really will draw me back to this place is that you can build your own pizza for 7.95, with no limit on toppings. You could literally build a 4 lb pizza and still only pay $7.95 for the whole thing. And while I probably won't abuse that policy too much, my mind is definitely spinning with all the possibilities of different artisan pizzas I can think up. 

They have every ingredient you could want on a pizza! Ranging from goat cheese, Gorgonzola cheese, mozzarella, sea salt, olives, pepperoni, bacon, feta cheese, Italian sausage, salami, smoked ham, and many others. Not to mention they have different sauces for your base as well, ranging from your classic tomato base, a spicy Italian red sauce, a white sauce and BBQ as well. I'm especially excited to try something with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms or something :) YUM!",1

The bar is highly understaffed, my thing is don't have a giant bar that can sit 40 people around plus have drink orders come in from all of the tables and only have two or sometimes even only ONE bartender, its just not practical

4871395,3,"Ladder 15 is interesting.  When they first opened up - there were an interestingly designed and set up sports bar.  The food was typical bar food, and not all that creative.  Recently, they have changed a lot.  David Ansill is there now I believe, and he is awesome. I loved his food and his old restaurant off of South St.   The drinks are pretty good, the beer list is good too now.  It's improved greatly since I was there when they first opened.  I do like the decor, and I like the arrangement of the space.  I also like that during the summer time they keep their big windows open.  Creates a cool illusion of being inside / outside at the same time.  I have been there LATE and they definitely charge cover now ($5) and they have a strange dress code.  I don't really know how I feel about that.  I also find that they attract a pretty predictable crowd.  I also don't know how I feel about that.  I hear from a lot of friends that they are good for happy hours for groups - so if you are a part of an organization looking for a place to host a happy hour - this is possibly a good bar to go to.  It is also centrally located and  really predictable.  I always know what I'm getting into when I go there.  Which is good. Service can be iffy.  

Overall, go there if you want to catch a sporting event and its mid-week. Weekends, forget it. Too busy and they charge cover - which is ridiculous.  NOT worth the $5 to get in AND have to pay for drinks.  There are plenty of other bars near by that don't charge cover and that even have better drinks and better music.",1

Sometimes I'm at the restaurant on a weekly basis so I can't tell you how many times I've been.

My wife had the pork chop and I had the fried chicken.  She said the pork chop ""was a life-changing experience"".  To call it a ""chop"" is very unfair.  It was incredibly tender and flavorful.  Not a morsel of fat on it.  Another commentator called it a dinosaur leg, and I would not disagree.

My fried chicken was moist and flavorful, although not over the top.  And the portion was generous.

Service was impeccable.  Can't say enough about our wait staff.

Run, do not walk to NOLA's.",1
2492092,5,"Couch tomato café is where its at!

I've been frequenting this joint since my college days, and whenever I'm in the Manayunk area for work/visiting friends, I make it a point to stop in.

What makes this place so unique is their approach to food. Everything they use is fresh and local (when possible). They keep the ingredients in their purest form, and have fun with textures/flavor profiles when it comes to their pizzas, wraps, salads, etc. The service is always on point as well.

I was in the area a week or so ago and stopped in for lunch between meetings. When I was in college, I used to create my own wrap with spring greens, goat cheese, candied pecans, turkey, and apple with a maple Dijon vinaigrette. I was feeling nostalgic and decided to go for it - and it tasted just as amazing as it had a couple of years ago! Consistency is so important, so I am glad to know they are keeping a good thing going. 

This place is a must if you are in the area, make sure you stop in - you won't be disappointed!",1
5452609,5,"The gyro taco is the best!!! But honestly, all of the tacos are great! And cheese dip is a must. Great margs and great atmosphere. An added bonus is the food comes out Uber fast",1
2445831,4,"Went to restaurant under the assumption that if a restaurant has been around this long it has to be decent. Wasn't disappointed. Good portions, yummy margaritas, and their guacamole was amazing. Got basic combination meals this time, and were churros and sopapillas, tasty with chocolate sauce. Would return. Service was a bit slow so don't go here if you are in a hurry. More of a kick back and relax feel.",1

Delicious craft beer.

Fantastic service.

Mouthwatering food. Their Hoosier Tenderloin Sandwich is incredible. Get it with a side of Pimento cheese!

4277039,5,"There are probably fifty items on the menu, but they are all very similar. If you order five different chaats, tomorrow it will seem as though you had five plates of the same/similar item. But it is always very delicious, and the service is always fast and friendly. They will prepare it in less time than it took you to order it. I can't count how many times I've been here, and I don't see my visits becoming any less frequent in the future!",1
1141788,5,"Our first meal in Edmonton couldn't have been better. Lovely, well-appointed space sets the scene for a wonderful meal. Started with the charred cauliflower, which had us speechless. Very, very good. I went with the short rib tortelloni and it was perfect, rich with flavor. My girlfriend was in love with the gnocchi. Pudding for dessert was a delightful capper to the meal.",1
5671971,4,"Like Bill G, I will give this a ""hopeful 4.""  Despite the other reviews, we were very impressed with how the waitstaff handled the mob scene that was the second weekend of the restaurants opening.  There were some opening weekend glitches, namely, they were out of several of the beers on the menu.  Despite having to settle for third choice beers, we were very happy with the burgers.  I have to say, the decor just doesn't seem to fit the neighborhood or the menu - felt more like a chain restaurant than a local beer/burger place.",1

I only gave three stars because there's a guy working in your kitchen with a massive beard and no net on it.",1

2331940,4,"Definitely an improvement from the first time I came 5 months ago. I do wish they took more time on my feet because they still are pretty dry. And I really think they need to add a pedicure for men.  But they have been improving! 




Thought I would try this place instead of going to the Nail Bar. And I wish I never did. We walked in and there was no one was the desk so we stood there until someone noticed us. We got checked in and walked back to our seats. No one helped to turn on the chairs, or even bothered. The water was ungodly hot and they use these plastic bags in the tubs which just seem lazy and cheap to me. My technician was doing a fine job but spent WAY too much time on my legs and not on my feet. At the end, my feet still look dry, i have nail polish all over my toes, and my nails were not cut and filed evenly. Their only solution to fixing the problem was putting another coat of polish on. So I said no thanks, paid and left. Guess I will have to stick with the Nail Bar from now on.",1

Good thing, because it was very crowded!  We were seated promptly and served attentively and efficiently.  I had a vegetarian dish--mushrooms, green beans, and eggplant in a deliciously spicy Thai sauce. My husband had grilled Brussels sprouts and steak, which he enjoyed tremendously. The chef/owner came out and chatted very courteously with us after we finished. They have an excellent beer/wine/cocktails menu.  A satisfying, enjoyable meal....we will be back!",1

The staff was really nice and helped us out with recommendations and samples right away. I ordered a piña colada and it was good, but very sweet. We only stayed for one drink. I imagine this place would be more fun when there are ships docked or at a busier time of day.",1

4727503,5,"Fat Noodle is a must for Tucson ramen fans! The legendary food truck has apparently been meaning to open a restaurant, and here it is! This place is no joke. They cook the broth traditionally over two days, and the noodles are house made with locally sourced wheat. Despite all this work, the prices are reasonable, the ramen is amazing, and the service is stellar. Ramon, Albert and Sabrina will take care of you. Get it quick before the line out the door makes you wait!",1
2878329,5,Place is awesome. Coolest atmosphere out of all the coffee shops in Indy. 1 free refill with your drip coffee. I haven't had the food yet but it looks great. They also have draft beer and cocktails here that sound and look amazing. I will have to come back tonight and give them a try!,1

30506,4,"We are attending a volleyball tournament in Tampa and decided to stay in and order food to avoid the Valentine restaurant rush. We ordered the fried ravioli. Caesar salad, fettuccine Alfredo with a house salad and pasta marinara with garlic knots. We used the yelp app to order delivery. It gave us a window of 70-90 minutes. It was closer to 2 hours but our hotels valet is jammed and there is a hockey game down the street. The salads were fresh and delicious. The Caesar and Greek dressing were probably the best I have ever had. The pasta was good. The garlic knots and ravioli were delicious. I would give them 5 stars except for the fact that they did not include silverware in the to go order to a hotel. I had to go to the restaurant in the hotel and ask for silverware. Not a big deal except it was already 9 pm and I was in my jammies. The hotel staff may be traumatized for life. I would however for sure dine in and order from them again and ask for silverware!",1
730667,5,"Nice! This is the first time having a cheesesteak for me. I really enjoyed it! The sandwiches are really fast and fresh, and the service is really friendly. I recommend their roast beef and roast pork sandwiches, but back away from the Italian sausage. It's just bread and sausage. If you're close by, give it a try!",1
5440445,5,"I love this place. Great matzo ball soup, great sandwiches, awesome breakfasts like matzo Brei and scrambled eggs with whatever you want in them. 
This place is a classic Jewish deli (not kosher), with an awesome bakery that does good challah, black and white cookies, knishes etc. I go to this place at least twice a month just for the Reuben and pickles. 
If you get your sandwiches ""New York sized"" it is literally one of the biggest sandwiches, and could absolutely feed 4 people.",1

I need my air conditioners. I know from experience good mechanics can be booked and hard to find. But lucky for me I SCORED!!! I was able to get in the next day. So I shored up at a RV park the night before ( LazyDays RV park 2 miles away ) and had shore power to tie me over. I was in and out in of Simonson's in approx 3.5 hours. Problem solved.

2087962,5,"A really enjoyable dinner. Shared the octopus appetizer and an artichoke appetizer. The octopus is a generous portion that is succulent, slightly smoky and extremely tender with an olive oil basting that moves the meat toward silky. The artichoke is cooked to an al dente consistency with a light oil and lemon sauce. A hint of anchovies add a salty back drop. 

Enjoyed  a buttery but light Dover Sole filleted table side yielding 4 small pillows of meat free of bones. Served with a small cache of roasted new potatoes and a garlicky kale. 

Also enjoyed a squid ink pasta with a small mountain of crab meat. The fresh pasta contrasts perfectly with the sweet crab. 

Double espresso, gelato and an on the house homemade limoncello capped the meal.",1
4950630,4,"Best cheese and margarita pizzas in the city!!! The dough is chewy on the inside crispy on the outside. The pizza rolls are a delicious twist. The pizza dough and toppings are wrapped up like a croissant and sauce is on the side!  Good salads. Love that you can order via grubhub. I would have given 5 stars except the sandwiches and pastas are just average.  In fact the chicken parm sandwich was very dry and tasted terrible. Order pizza, pizza rolls, or a salad and you will never be disappointed.",1
5145092,5,"Top notch all the way from food to service, yummy!!! All the appetizers are good and my food was fish, too die for.  Dessert was a sampler from pecan pie to lemon drop pie.  Intimate great for a date or a really nice meal, not cheap to say the least.",1

3222155,4,"Had the BBQ + Hotpot combo. The hotpot was better than the BBQ based on what I had. Tomyum base was great. The house special base was so so. Ribeye was on the thinner side and did not quite look like the pictures. The ddukbokki had a weird after taste to me.

I didn't taste much rum if any in the mojito i had. I would suggest sticking to beer or soju or wine here. 

The service was fantastic. Jimmy was attentive and took good care of us. 

I would visit this place again, but would definitely be more selective about what I order.

Pro tip: Grill the pineapple from the dessert bar on the BBQ grill. 
Next Level Pro tip: Bring cinnamon for the grilled pineapple.",1

The personality of a restaurant comes from the owner and High Point's owner and head barista Meg is the friendliest soul in Mt Airy and the High Point has become the neighborhood's unofficial club house.

It's always crowded, always has a line but somehow you always get your drink and accompanying yummy pastry or crepe or quiche quickly and you always get a table when you need it.  

Adopt a dog, buy some art, share a table and smile.

Just to correct Mark A, the High Point is not ""affiliated"" with Weaver's Way although Meg buys her milk there!",1

I had my young child, and they were very kind with her even when she made a mess (dropped her sucker and it shattered all over the floor). I bought a beginners set - heavy duty (BPA free)  Perfectea maker, tea tin, measuring spoon, bag of sugar, and some Bellini Tea - it was all on sale and we received $10 off  (for signing up for emails)The tea has a perfect summer vibe. It's delicious and the aroma is beautiful.  I can't wait to try more teas.  I want to mention in closing, that the young woman that assisted us was super friendly (not pushy) and explained the brewing process and the product throughly.  She was sincere about wanting us to know what we were doing to that we could experience the tea properly - she really cared.  The young man that cleaned up our little mess, was kind and made light of the accident.  Will go back and sample more teas soon!!",1

4984118,5,I was in NOLA for a business trip but was trying to squeeze in some touristy stuff too. since I was essentially traveling alone and on a tight schedule I opted for an organized tour instead of wandering  the streets alone. My hotel concierge recommended French Quarter Phantoms. I am so glad he did. I went on a cemetery tour on a Sunday morning and my tour guide Lena was absolutely awesome. She was so knowledgeable about the history  of the city and her enthusiasm was contagious. It truly felt like she had the excitement of someone conveying a story for the first time not the thousandth which it probably was. Her humor was also just the right amount considering we were touring a cemetery. She answered all questions thrown at her and everyone on the tour seemed equally engaged. I would definitely recommend the tour to anyone seeking to go to the cemetery.,1

We ordered a cheese tray, meat tray and the pecan catfish.  We also ordered a bottle of wine.  My husband had to track our waitress, Linda, when the wine never materialized.  When he found the bottle of wine at the waiter station outside he tried to just take it to our table but she insisted.  She really struggled with getting the bottle open. Then we received our cheese and meat tray but pecan catfish never showed up.  Linda looked like she was on drugs and had no idea of what was going on. There was a gentleman waiter working outside named Urick and he was excellent.  So all of this being said I am giving them three stars because the food was great but the service sucked.",1

3410961,4,"This location is a bit of a social distance nightmare. It's a truck outside of a bar or 2 + other food trucks. I honestly couldn't tell because the layout was so confusing and there were people everywhere. Luckily Prince has tables hidden away from the giant tv outside so no one wants to sit there. 

They have a limited menu, but all I need is tenders and fries anyways! I got the Nashville Hot. It was spicy, but not terrible. The meat was juicy, but I wish it was crispier. Fries were solid. We ate pretty quick to escape the crowd and it probably took away from the experience. 

I recommend getting it to go though to try out the place that started it all!",1

DEFINITELY ask for Juan when you go in he's a great barber amazing at what he does.",1
5496898,5,"I have to admit that initially, I wasn't quite as excited as my fiance about our reservation for beddia. I saw a couple of reviews and photos and though it looked good, I couldn't quite appreciate how good.  When we arrived on Friday night, that all changed. 

The space is industrial with a clear view to the kitchen, where you can see Chef Joe himself cooking and serving up apps and pies to customers.  Yes, its small (hence our 2 month wait for a reservation), but  it helps create an intimate feel - very intimate, as we were essentially dining with the couples on either side of us. (Pro-tip: come with a group of 6, and you'll get a more spacious booth.) 

We had the tomato pie to start, which was somehow inexplicably better than any version I've had before. We also went for two pies - it seemed excessive for two people at first, but I was so glad we did.  The classic cheese was delicious, but the white pizza with swiss chard was unbelievable.  Swiss chard on a pizza doesn't sound especially appetizing, but something about the crispy, salty topping made for the most magical combination on pizza I think I've ever had. 

I'd be remiss not to mention the wine list.  My fiance opted for Tired Hands on tap (always a solid), but I couldn't resist the natural wine on tap - it was so good, we stayed for an extra glass over soft serve.  And as bland as soft serve for dessert sounds, it was actually some of the best I've had, thick and creamy. 

So glad we made it here already - can't wait to come back.",1

This time I had the Shrimp Volcano roll...
Tuna, Cream Cheese, Cucumbers, Avocado, Sweet Eel Sauce, Spicy Aioili Sauce, Topped with: Tempura Shrimp, Spicy Mayo, Scallion, Masago... amazing!

We booked the last tour of the evening on a Friday night hoping for a bit of theatrics under the cover of dark but really felt like the guide was just ready to be done. All in all I wouldn't waste the money doing this again. And if you book through Groupon be sure and read the fine print as Witches Brew not accommodate you even when you've purchased for a group of more than 20 people. Save your money. Go to any of the many voodoo shops around town and they will give you the same stories for free.,1

I love Mac and Cheese Burgers, so of course that was my go to, and I was def happy with my choice! The Mac and cheese was actually really really good by itself, and on top of a burger was ridiculous!

Each burger patty was 1/2 pound, so my double was 1 lb and was so delicious I still wanted more! The burger was high quality, and has a real burger taste. Although it was a large burger, it wasn't super greasy compared to the smaller fast food burgers.

Def a foodie must try",1

I recommend their lunch specials!",1

6724688,5,First time trying Basque food and it was delicious. You pay $1-$4 per appetizer. It's a great way to sample. Staff was helpful to us newbies explaining the food and brought us a carafe of ice water to our table. They have outdoor seating which is where we sat. We will definitely be back.,1
5833005,5,"I found this place when I was at the bike shop next door. I couldn't help but notice the amazing smells coming out of this pizza shop. I stopped in and grabbed a menu, but couldn't get any pizza that day. 

A couple of weeks later I finally got the chance to get some pizza, and I knew where to go. We are new in town and have tried a few places, but haven't been overly excited about any of them yet. We were still searching for the ultimate pizza place. 

I think I found it. This pizza is pretty cheap and they have some good deals, $14 for 2 md cheese pizzas for example. This night we decided on a 14inch with mushroom, onion, and meatball. It was delicious! I and I can't wait to get the chance to order from them again. Best pizza so far in St. Louis (although I hear Imo's is good, haven't had it yet). 

Go to Pointer's, you should not be disappointed. Plus like others have mentioned they have that GIGANTIC pizza. Holy crap was that thing huge.",1
2189705,4,"This place is huge!  I spent time in the bar on the left hand side as you enter and enjoyed a hurricane which was highly recommended by all.  This place is definitely a tourist spot ( I prefer to hang with locals) so we left shortly thereafter.  In any case, stop by and have a hurricane.",1

5024405,5,This place is near and dear to my heart. I have been going here half of my life and i still order the same dishes. At least three of the servers date back to my high school choo choos days. The prices still rock i think dishes cost .50 cent to 1.50 more than 14 years ago. I should start to try new things there but why mess with a good thing?,1
4880078,5,"Was there today had the fish tacos all I have to say is yummy also try the new ultimate margarita which is very good and fresh. I notice this is not the typical mexican restaurants u will find in indy u dont have the speedy gonzales special or none of that I have to say i have found my new favorite place for mexican food and for mexican drinks 

They now have a full liquor license and there currently working on the bar",1
2916833,4,"I work nearby and sometimes stop in for a takeout order. In my experience the staff has been nice and the food excellent. It's a bit more expensive than i would like, but is in line with nearby CWE restaurants. It's a great addition to the neighborhood and I'm very happy to have  a Middle Eastern option available if I want to go out for lunch or dinner.",1
4119489,5,Absolutely by far best subs and hero's. Fresh and bread is crusty. Staff eager to please. They only take cash.,1
3403729,4,"I was originally going to give this place 2 or 3 stars but the kindness of the waitress and one less than ideal experience compared to other decent experiences changed my mind. They seem short staffed - 1 waitress for the whole dining area and it was consistently busy the entire 2 hours that I was there. 

Service - We had a few hiccups. The table was sticky so we wiped it ourselves with hand sanitizer and a napkin. The napkin was so dirty afterwards. I advise you wipe or check the cleanliness your table before ordering and eating. There is a QR code on the table where you scan and place your order. The service was slow and the food took a while to come out. They said it's because their kitchen is backed up. We also had to ask for water 3x before we got it. When the bill came, the waitress wrote ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" so sweet!!

Food - We ordered 3 pots of tea (Jasmine Green Milk Tea, Jardin Tropical, Darjeeling Margaret), twister fries, Trio Combo, Strawberry Shortcake, Takoyaki, Crabmeat Pizza and Turkey Sandwich. We were pleased with our teas. The fries and takoyaki were good. The Crabmeat pizza and strawberry shortcake were decent. The Turkey sandwich was disappointing. On the menu, it said the sandwich had bacon and cheese but it didn't. When we told the waitress, she said the sandwich never came with bacon and cheese. If that is the case, they should remove those ingredients off the menu. It's an online menu, so I'm sure they can easily make that change. The waitress was nice enough to remove it off the bill and allowed us to switch it for another another item. We requested a Katsu Chicken Sandwich. The chicken was good. This sandwich made up for the other one. I can't believe they are the same price. The Turkey sandwich is not worth $8.50. 

Items I would order again - The teas, fries, takoyaki, crabmeat pizza and Katsu chicken sandwich.",1
1771243,4,"I'm fairly picky about Mexican food and generally dislike more places than I like. With a 3-star rating on Yelp plus some other negative feedback I'd heard about Rosalita's, I didn't hold out much hope, but I really liked it! I mainly wanted to go because the interior just looked so darn cute. And I'm willing to sacrifice food quality for some great atmosphere once in awhile. But the food was good, so it's a win-win. Now, I only tried the beef soft tacos and that's probably one of the harder Mexican foods to make badly, but they were good. Nice seasoning, shredded lettuce and cheese. Just the basics. Served with rice and beans. The rice and beans were average, but I did find it weird that there were small, diced carrots in the Mexican rice. For $8 you get three beef tacos. They use smaller tortillas than other places, but three is still plenty. Actually, two was plenty for me.

For the chips and salsa alone I'd give this place five stars. Everyone has their own opinion of the best type of salsa (and chips) and it was like Rosalita's made theirs specifically with me in mind. The salsa was not chunky and was very cilanto-y. The chips were super thin. The fact that they weren't salted is my only complaint.

Our waiter was incredibly nice, but unfortunately service was about the only negative part of our dining experience. The restaurant was doing a good business, but definitely not crowded. I don't even think the upstairs section was open. Even so, our drinks sat unfilled several times, along with the empty chip and salsa containers. We were left without flatware and napkins for quite a while and I had to ask for sweetener for my iced tea (it was mango and terrific!). If it was that bad on a semi-slow night, I'd hate to be there when it was busy.",1
25659,5,"My son has been coming here since he was 9 months old, and he is now starting kindergarten. All the staff at this daycare are amazing. They care about all the kids, from the shy ones to the rambunctious ones like my son. Your child really gets a quality education here. My son knows Spanish, can count in multiples and knows the alphabet. The teachers make sure the kids are ready for kindergarten. My child grew up here and putting him in this daycare was one of the best decisions I have ever made for him.",1

Went around lunch time and while it was super busy but I easily placed and order and found a table (they give you a number and bring your food to you) service was fast and food came out hot had the buckboard bacon melt which was awesome and the colored greens had a nice spicy taste to them. Highly recommend this spot for lunch,1
6451689,3,"My initial review a year ago was five stars; it has now been downgraded. The last few times we have dined here have been subpar. I learned that they no longer serve cappuccino because they don't have a machine to make them yet it hasn't been removed from the Brunch menu. Another time they were lacking an ingredient that is included in a handful of their dishes on the menu and I had to choose another option, which was hard to do since I specifically was seeking a meal with this ingredient. The potatoes are salty and it's hit or miss on the flavor. Their various Benny options are pretty consistent, assuming they have all the ingredients to make said meals. Lastly, I have noticed during Brunch there seems to be minimal staff working, which doesn't seem very efficient because it gets busy and the establishment is quite large for only a few servers to manage.  I want this to be my go-to Brunch place again but for now, we have found another establishment.",1

2455960,3,"This is my favourite public pool. It's in my neighbourhood and it's never all that busy, so it's great for lane swims. Unfortunately, right now it's closed for renos, until end of Oct/2008. Apparently work needs to be done that has been neglected for a while, but nothing that has interfered with my experience there. The staff is friendly and helpful. The change rooms are clean and there's a steam sauna. This is one of the only salt-water pools in the city, a feature I could take or leave, except that I don't smell like chlorine for the next two days after I swim there. It's not as hard on the hair or skin, and they still use the proper chemicals to keep the pool up to standard. I like that in the deep end there's a little ledge you can stop and rest on. The hours are good, with daily public swims, adult swims and lane swims. Drop-in is about $4.50.",1
4168492,5,"Both my husband and I had a unique opportunity (offer) to use the professional services offered by Fashion Eye Center and we were extremely satisfied.  The eye exams and resulting prescriptions were spot-on and the doctor was so very thorough.  

Assisting us in selecting the frames and lens was Joe.  He  knew his products so well, would advise us on what looked best on us and what kind of lens was best for our particular eye situations.  Such a professional young man, so patient and helpful.   

Yesterday we picked up our glasses and our whole outlook improved (literally) by leaps and bounds!  This was a first visit for us but it will certainly not be the last.  We'll be coming back as regular customers from now on.",1

So, I was excited to see single serving slices of pumpkin pie complete with what looks to be a bit of pralined pecans and whipped cream for 3.95. Really not that bad. The grocery also sells my favorite tea, lavender earl grey! I wish I worked near this place. They have the most fabulous salad bar. They also have a lot of tasty entrees package up for dinner! 

Stop in next time you are shopping on 13th street!

p.s. my favorite thing they sell, but I am too cheap to buy are the bindi and lolita mixers for margaritas.etc!",1

The food was okay, although there was a line for that, and it also ran out early.",1

Our waiter was great & knowledgeable. The cozy ambiance of the restaurant perfect for a date night. The highlight was the gorgonzola filet appetizer, portion sizes were perfect and we enjoyed the table side service.
The only issue we had was with a bar beverage made & charged on our bill incorrectly. This was remedied immediately by the manager Jay.  If we find ourselves in the area again, we'll definitely stop in for another yummy meal!",1

As my family was celebrating a birthday, they acknowledged it and gave the birthday girl a $25 gift card, a signed card from the staff, plus a box of truffles to take home! I visited here during Devour Indy (North) and the menu was amazing. I seriously think I had the best lobster tail I have ever had in my life. My filet was cooked to perfection and my dessert (carrot cake) was to die for. I enjoyed this place thoroughly and will be back.",1

3470498,5,"TOP NOTCH!! Thank you Josh, and TNT, you educated us and made our home much much homier‼ 

we have a 5 month old Spoo pup - and we went on vacation for 5 days and kenneled him - the potty training is done but the urine smell apparently was not - boy did pungent PUNCH  us directly in the face when we walked in yesterday. GROSS - I JUST WISH I HAD TAKEN BEFORE PICS  ‼

They had a slot for us today - their chemist Josh brought out the bad boy BLACK light - I was speechless at the mess everywhere - and then appalled and sadly impressed at how thoroughly peed on our carpet was - we turned off the lights and closed the curtains and plain as day, large swathes of urine stains everywhere. Total crime scene investigation stuff. And we have one of those carpet cleaners for the home and we were diligent to treat every puddle we found and apparently didn't remove a thing!!  

Not to be graphic but I mean splatter was up and down the stairs and Jackson Pollack style pee on literally every spot of the upstairs carpet - and they did our stairs and they look amazing - he went everywhere except oddly enough not where either of us step out of bed so there was that - but the rest of the space was his toilet - see enclosed, he's adorable and we love him - but wow. 

Anyway, long graphic story short and delightfully sweet, the pee smell and spots are gone and Josh gave us oatmeal color carpets again where brown once existed - we cleaned them last year but not with this company - 

TNT was recommended to us by our neighbor and we actually cannot say enough about TNT! They even had a special for October - had two for one pet care - and we needed four treatments to get up the HAZMAT scene - so we felt it was a bargain - and he was in and out in two hours and it was mostly dried in 5 hours. I loved walked in the carpet without my slippers - so decadent!!

690978,5,"While dragging my friend along the NJ wine trail, we decided to make this stop to appease him. It turned out to be a wonderful spot that really shouldn't be missed!
This distillery makes vodka, gin, aquavit, and moonshine. For a few bucks you can get a flight of all of these offerings. I'm not a liquor person at all but I really enjoyed the flight and tasting these different types of spirits.  In addition to the flight, you can also buy cocktails and bottles to take home. 
The vibe is super chill and friendly. The lady who owns the distillery is absolutely lovely and knowledgeable. Along with the great drinks we were also offered delicious pub mix! Much appreciated!
The distillery is on a very nice bit of ground and one can bring their own food and enjoy the spirits, weather, and company.",1

I've been back several times since. The drinks are amazing. Don't be afraid to ask the bartenders for advice on what to order. At $10+ per drink, it should be something you're going to like. And I'm pretty sure you will.  Also, the drinks are good and strong. Another bid selling point for me is that they stock Miller High Life.

It's easy to stay for several hours and enjoy time with friends. We went on a 15 degree day and were able to comfortably golf outside under the heat lamps without our coats on. The buckets of beer were pretty expensive and there were no drink specials, which was a downer. Make sure you download the app and register as a member to skip the line. And finally, don't bother ordering the nachos unless you only want SIX chips. Terrible portion size! Did not order any other food after that.",1

3675889,4,"From KC and in town for the weekend and couldn't resist trying this place out. Good seafood in a land locked state?? Who knew! Showed up right at dinner opening at 4:30 on Friday night. Skipped the valet and had no problem finding street parking. 

Server's name was Alex I believe and he was extremely attentive without being over bearing which is a difficult balance to find. 

For food we got the Conneticut style lobster roll, crab roll, kettle chips, corn on the cob, and the Lyonnaise salad. For me the star was the Lyonnaise salad followed by the lobster roll. The salad had fried oysters, lardons (thick bacon bits basically), poached egg, mixed greens, and a bacon mustard vinaigrette. The oysters tasted so fresh and bursting with flavor. Perfectly poached egg and a unique dressing which I will be craving for forever. The lobster roll was straight forward. A generous amount drizzled in butter on a butter toasted brioche. The crab roll was sweet but tasty. Kettle chips, just okay, I have had better. Corn on the cob was out of season so also just okay. 

Pricing wasn't cheap. Market price on lobster roll this weekend was 25.50 and the crab roll was 19.00 but for the experience and quality we got I would pay it again.",1

1001516,5,"I came here this last weekend for the first time. The place wasn't very crowded, so it was easy to find a seat in the bar area. They had the Giants and Phillies game playing, so all the better.

Our server was extremely nice and attentive. He never let our glasses get close to empty. Their menu is unique and wasn't the normal bar fare. I ordered the chicken and penne pasta with a chipotle vermouth tomato sauce. The dish was fantastic. it had large chunks of onions and the sauce was to die for. My only complaint on the dish was it could have been served with some complimentary garlic bread. The server did come through and gave me some french bread for free.

My date ordered the pork chop with a mashed root potato, dijon mustard sauce and baked apple with cranberries. This dish was amazing. I kept taking bites from my dates plate. The pork chop is 14 ounces of goodness and was perfectly cooked. 

We had their homemade ice cream...a scoop of coconut and a scoop of almond roca. They were both delicious.

The collection is vast, so vast that for me I had to focus on a couple of areas of interest and plan to return for more detailed viewing of other sections. 

The only real cons I can state are the hours - 9am-4pm Tues-Fri is limiting, and the heat. The collection is upstairs and has no cooling, presumably to preserve and not dry out the collection, so it is very, very hot up there. There are a couple of stand fans and some of the windows were open but the heat cut my visit short.

4850346,3,"Just came back from Santa Barbara and stayed at the Milo. I get why the reviews are all over the place. First let me say, it was a fine stay, not perfect but nice enough. I'd liken it to a high end motel, not a luxury hotel. For those prices it's easy to be annoyed - It's close by the beach and if anyone has ever stayed by the beach, beach spots get a lot of wear and tear, Venice, Manhattan, Hermosa, Redondo. Milo is no different, rooms are small but clean, if you like quiet, it's not the place, I heard dogs and kids, fond of both but don't want to be bothered while on vacay. We asked to be moved twice and the staff was extremely amenable to us. They were the best part of the stay and the free wine too. Every time I was at the desk some guest was pissed about something and the staff remained calm and helpful. Dana was who helped us and she was awesome. It's also close to where everything is to do, a very short walk to the Funk Zone and restaurants/bars - so I'd say this... level set your expectations, if you are (and be honest) ""that person"" who needs everything to be perfect, stay elsewhere, if you can roll with things, it's a good decent location close to stuff and definitely a bit over priced... but you're paying for location and a ""beach view"" we left a day early but mostly because we got bored.",1

With her pleasant smile and knowledge of her profession, she kindly fixed it within seconds.  She asked that I return if I needed anything else fixed on my car.  She was a breath of fresh air and I told her I would return if I needed her help again.  Thank you Jessica for your quick resolution to my problem.",1
2576563,5,"Was strolling through the veterans museum and didn't realize it'd be a little over zealous of me to try and walk through it in its entirety without fueling myself...SOOO.. I FOUND this place on yelp. 

Tried their turkey sandwich..... perfection was found in every bite i took from beginning to end. It was loaded with meat, avocados, sprouts...

Was so delicious...I had it the very next day. 

The service was ordinary, nothing spectacular.",1

3860757,5,Such a great day. My daughter and I were a little nervous but ended up having a fabulous time. We saw some beautiful birds and a small alligator. Bingo was very knowledgeable and also gave us tips to explore the city. I think this is a must if you visit New Orleans!,1

1374547,4,"If someone asked me where I had the best pizza in Philadelphia, I would have to say it was at By George.  If they then said let's go there now and get a slice.  I would proably have to point out that we're really only going to get their best pizza at lunch time.  If it's later in the day, it's likely the slices have been out there a while.  They don't seem to make any more pizzas after lunch time.  Of course, you could always order an entire pizza to get around this.

There are three changes that I would like to see them make:
1) Open on Sunday.  It can be reduced hours if needed.
2) Mark down your pizza slices when you're closing soon.  It will help you sell what you have left over.  And at the sametime, it's fairer to the customers not to charge the same price as if the pizza just came out of the oven.
3) Offer a vegan pizza.  It would be interesting to see what you could do with some Daiya cheese.  And I would understand you requiring an entire pizza to be ordered instead of taking a slice.

By George is one of my favorite pizza places.  If you haven't been there, you should try them for lunch.",1
5664199,4,"Can't say enough nice things about this place. We reserved a block of rooms for our wedding which was on the day before the season opener game against Atlanta and they DIDN'T gouge us at all. The rates were very reasonable. My wife and I had a suite and they let us have it for the same price as the other rooms. The suite was very nice, clean, comfortable bed. We didn't want to leave. They had food and drinks for the brides maids and grooms men as they got ready. Lots of extra touches thrown in. Very thoughtful and we felt well taken care of and very confident that our guests were too. My only complaint would be the elevators, which were small, slow, and stuffy. Other than that it was a great experience and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone.",1
5462149,5,A must stop in New Orleans! Such a quaint and historical spot. Really enjoyed the muffuletta and pimms cup. Jambalaya was so so. Overall great service and food for a reasonable price.,1
655534,4,"If you're looking for creamy ice cream to combat the humid, hot weather, come to Mike's Ice Cream. Such a refreshing and much-needed dessert to munch on during our exploration of Downtown Nashville after dinner.

Sadly, they didn't have the containers for sundaes, so we weren't able to try their banana split and also no samples available to test different ice cream flavors. The inside wasn't terribly packed with people, but we didn't feel comfortable sticking around once we got our ice cream.

+ PARKING: Since Downtown Nashville was pretty much dead due to COVID-19, it was extremely easy to find STREET PARKING right across the street from Mike's.

+ FOOD: The ice cream is all hand-made here at Mike's and they offer everything from ice cream scoops on a cone to shakes to ice cream sodas. Their flavors aren't really as wacky as I've seen from some artisan ice cream shops, but interesting enough to put a twist on classic flavors.

We went with your classic STRAWBERRY ice cream and a new-to-us TENNESSEE FUDGE ice cream scoop in a cup. The strawberry was so good! This isn't just your basic store-bought strawberry pint variety. The strawberry ice cream at Mike's comes with generous chunks of strawberry and I swear our ice cream took forever to actually melt. But that's maybe because we gobbled up all our ice cream too fast. It was so smooth and amount of ice cream in their scoops is generous! The strawberry paired really well with their Tennessee fudge. The Tennessee fudge is supposedly their best-selling flavor and it's a vanilla-based ice cream with ribbons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chunks mingled in. Not too rich to the point where my teeth ached, but just enough chocolate to satisfy my craving. The bits of fudge were delicious and I liked how we accidently ended up with a neapolitan ice cream combo with our two scoops.

We were also able to snag some Goo Goo Clusters here! (As if we needed more sugar in system)

+ PRICE: Competitive and even borderline cheap for the amount of ice cream they pack in their scoops. Most artisan ice cream shops I've come across would charge the same price for 2/3 the amount of ice cream Mike's gives you. For two scoops of ice cream (large), they charge about $5. What a steal!

Overall: If you're in Downtown Nashville, give this place a try. I highly recommend their ice cream and it'll keep you cool. Classic flavors and offerings with a little modern twist.",1
741421,5,"Great new coffee house! They have a variety of sandwiches and smoothies, and their coffee is delicious.

6521387,3,"We went to see Chus & Ceballos the day after thanksgiving.  It was our first time to Rumor and we've always been disappointed with the ""House"" clubs in Phiily.  

We were on a list so the typical $20 cover was reduced to $15.  Typically, with a cover like this you'd expect the club to be open to 3am however, Rumor is only open to 2am.  The bouncers and staff were very professional, they kept the line moving.  We only had to wait outside for roughly 15 minutes.

Once in we made a bee line for the bar which was crowded but the bartenders were quick to serve us.  The drinks were faily pricey but on par with other center city clubs.

The club itself was designed and style much like the underground NYC house clubs with led, neon and strobe lights pulsating to the deep bass beats.

The dance floor was a mix of dancing couples and dancing gay men, the gay couple we were with knew most of them so we quickly made many new friends.  

The huge downside was the bathrooms; only 3 single bathrooms for the club.  I had to wait in line for 20 minutes everytime I needed to use one.  

Overall, we had a good time and I'll go back simply because it seems to be the only Philly club that can bring in NYC quality DJs.",1
6883561,5,"Never been here before this review, but I took my wife's bike that hasn't been ridden in over 20 years. The dropout bike shop made it look amazing and it was a beautiful ride.

I ordered the catfish , crab legs and shrimp combo,Dungeness crab legs and hush puppies. I got he mixed sauce which was  amazing!!!! And the garlic one which was ok. Overall everything I ordered was great so I was happy about that. My only complaint was the portion size for the price you pay. They are expensive and you don't get much. However, they do give a 10% off I guess for new business. Now I'll be heading over to get some more",1

I tried some of their barbacoa tacos for the first time on 11/28, and found myself back again only six days later.

This restaurant is beautiful too..with several bars and indoor outdoor dining.",1
1405354,4,"This is a nice park, though having some advanced knowledge of their policies and procedures is important to maximize your visit. For example, we pre-paid for parking but couldn't find a spot in two of their side lots. We then parked along the curved road adjacent to the train tracks (fine by me!). Once we parked and walked along, we then saw a parking garage with zoo animals on it. Was that were our parking was valid for? We don't know, and calling the number led to a voice message saying they were short staffed and we should send them a message via their webpage. Not helpful. 

Some of the exhibits were closed... either due to Covid directly, or due to lack of staffing. I don't like a lot of the inside buildings anyway so I didn't mind, but many of the food things (ice cream, drinks, etc.) were shut down. 

The animals were fun to see and I saw some I usually don't get a chance to see. We really liked the red pandas, the giraffes, and I found the bear cute. Like all zoos, we seem to hit them at just the right time when the animals are taking naps. Apparently, lions and tigers see us coming and roll over just as we get to the walls. Meanwhile, the red panda(s) food us first by sleeping but when we doubled back later we got to see one playing around.

I like the overhead 360-tunnel/passages, and watching a cheetah walking above you is both cool and disconcerting. Seeing a confused monkey run back and forth was entertaining too. 

They seemed to cram a lot in the space they had. It all appeared to be well kept, and we really had a good time.",1
6665949,5,This place has some of the best Thai food I've ever had. The staff tonight were very friendly and my takeout was ready when I got there. I got the Tom Kha noodle soup with chicken and it might be my new favorite. Whenever I'm craving a noodle soup I always order from here.,1

No noodles in the pho and add the ""vegan mix"" which is just extra veggies.  We also had the bacon and shrimp spring rolls with no vermicelli.  The rest o the menu looks amazing.  We will definitely be taking a cheat meal soon and gorging on some of those noodle dishes.",1
5075779,4,"This was our first time at Thai Corner Cafe and we enjoyed our meal very much.  Our waitress was very good!  She checked on us frequently but, didn't stalk us, and made sure our drinks were filled. She was funny, friendly and attentive, which are qualities we appreciate in a good waitress.
We had the spring rolls, since there were so many rave reviews about those.  Honestly, we didn't find them so impressive. Maybe it was an off night for the chef? We partook of the Reno Roll, the Volcano Roll, and a Spider Roll. All were excellent with fresh ingredients and not too much sauce on them.  I did request Sriracha sauce instead of habenero on the Volcano roll as the habenero can be quite painful! :)  We had the miso soup and this was very tasty!  There wasn't very much tofu in it though, maybe 6 small pieces all together but, the flavor made up for it. Delicious!
I have to say it was certainly chilly in there too.  Everyone had to keep their jackets on.  The reason could have been because it was SO very cold outside New Years Eve. 
All in all, we really enjoyed our experience here and will certainly return.  We appreciated the fresh ingredients and the comfortable booth for our party of six, along with the waitress who was so good.
The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because one of our party didn't get his meal until the rest of us were over half way through our meals and the spring rolls were not very good. Not sure what happened there.",1

The only down side to the place is that every Tom, Dick, and Harry now wants to come here, but I'm not douchey enough to blame the business for being so damn good at what they do. Words cannot eloquently explain the goodness that is Pappy's. Go there and eat. You're Welcome.",1
2677678,3,"I felt the place to be small, but I did have a blast (esp at the one wall where you have to try and get the flag to stick very high). I beat everyone...even Miss Jeudy T.! 

Here are a few things I think this place needs:
-I do wish there would have been some more activities for the little ones though. My 2 yr old son really only had 2 things he was able to do and my baby didn't get to do anything. Other places, they would have an infant section where no one over 2 could enter (except for the adults with the infants of course) 

-They should also put some arcades in for anyone wanting to not really bounce. Maybe xbox or a wii so people can compete with each other

-Family restroom - my son got a bloody nose here (he ran into my wife's swinging arm by accident) and because they didn't have a family restroom, my wife had to clean him up by herself. It would have been nice if I could have gone in and helped her.

A plus is that the workers are very very nice. They kept up with the cleaning, serving people drinks and pizza, and helping anyone that needed it. The party room area where the food was served was a tad on the hot side though. Not sure if it was from the amount of people or if the air wasn't working, but if the air was working, they need to bump it to a cooler temp.

Overall: I hope they take my suggestions. If so, I'd def be back and throw a party here.",1

He's professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and most importantly honest! If you need a plumber, this is your guy! Support small businesses!",1
1839362,5,"I have been converted into a regular client by their affordable massage. We just relocated to the area and I have been looking for a good spa to go to that's not outrageous in rates. I tend to be very picky with my therapist as, coming from a place where massage is a big part of our healing culture, I grew up knowing how a good massage should feel. However, I also tend to be very loyal when I find a good therapist, as they don't come too often. That's when I found Angel. His technique is great, clearly understands anatomy by the way he hits the right spots and is very professional and thorough. In all honesty, he is the reason why I kept coming back since, even if the treatment was affordable, it won't be worth my time if it wasn't a great experience to begin with. I'd never book a treatment if it's not with him. I always leave this place feeling relaxed and like melted butter! 

I also tried their facial for the first time. It's supposed to be part of a combo but I upgraded to include extractions. While my esthetician Ana was good, I wished she was more thorough in the extraction part, after all, that's why I paid $55 instead of $25 for the treatment. While my skin looked soft and supple, I inspected my skin closer after I got home and saw a few areas with unextracted blackheads. That part was a bummer.'

Over all though, I will go back for the massage and maybe even for a facial, but will stick to the basic facial next time. The upgrade didn't seem worth it for me, but that's just my opinion.",1

Domino's has definitely improved over the years, but it's still sits in the realm of mediocre pizza as far as I'm concerned. Still a bit too doughy, although they've improved a bit in that department and I wish they included more pineapples on the Hawaiian. Not bad for the amount of pizza you get for the price. Dominos always comes through in that department.

The only reason I didn't give Miguel's 5 stars is that when they're really busy the food quality suffers.  For example the guacamole, which is usually made perfectly, can have huge lumps of avocado. One time there was a French fry in our guac...mixed in, not just sitting on top, and once my food had a small piece of plastic in it...looked like it was part of a plastic bag that the food came in (nothing that I could have choked on, but definitely a turn off).",1

When Pigs Fly is the perfect store for those times!!  The store is filled with cute, funny, unique, gimmicky items - perfect for the ever so stressful secret Santa gift exchange that always sneaks up on you so quickly.  The only problem is that there are so many neat things that appeal to me that being in this store really tests my self control. 

For mother's day I wanted to put together a gift basket full of items with a calming, soothing theme.  I found a bunch of really awesome things here (and from a few other stores down the Ave) and was able to completely personalize a basket for my kooky momma!

I find the prices to be higher here but I do appreciate that you can find unique items.  You don't find 80 bazillion of the same thing here like you do at the department/chain stores.  There are new and exciting items brought in regularly - but be advised - if you see something SUPER cute that you really like - don't hesitate - GET IT!!  Cuz maybe the next time you're there it will be gone and you will NEVER see it again!  But then that brings me to the reason for only a 3 star rating.

Customer service : front desk and reservations tend to go above and beyond I'm sure we have all had our issues at some point in time with a reservation but GSR has always pulled through and helped the best the can I travel a lot and this is the best front desk service I have received . 
Room : rooms are typically large and 8/10 clean . I have stayed here over 20 times and about 4 of those times I have delt with a house keeper that did not complete the cleaning job very well and left trash behind but front desk came through and fixed the issue 
House keeping : some house keepers are not from the US and there tends to be a language barrier and the also don't seem to understand ""do not disturb "" . It can get a little annoying but I have mentioned it to management hopefully it gets better . 
Security : I overall think security does a good job however some of them take there job to seriously jump to conclusions and start freaking out I was with a friend of mine and he was playing his video game and a security guard came to the room while I was showering and when I opened the door he said "" we have a complaint there is arguing in here and you guys will be kicked out if we come back ..."" so I told him to come in and once he saw the news was the video game he apologized and seemed interested in the game .... nevertheless he reacted to quickly . 
Bell desk : fast and efficient 
Overall gaming /gaming area : love the games hotel is roomy has lots of activities bowling ,VR,ice skating Fat Tuesday and more 
Pool :pool is always a plus they are heated and  jacuzzi is always warm clean area as well 
Food : not a big fan of the New Mexican restaurant not flavorful however Johnny rockets ,California pizza kitchen and Charlie palmers are great ! 
Seafood buffet when they have crab is good but take note the crab is served cold with hot butter",1
6345170,4,"New brewery very clean and great outside patio. The service is good, food good fries excellent. The beer is good, no surprise:-). We had the fish sandwich with corn coleslaw, a real treat for lunch time, the right taste, the right size; and the chicken sandwich with fries was tasty and enough to satisfy your hunger. I am recommending this place for its good food and good people watching spot.",1
1569411,5,"The best steakhouse in town. Make sure you have a booking. It's gets crowded- even during the week. The cuts are great and don't miss the Bone in Filet. It was cooked perfectly and tasted great. 

The sides are also fantastic but most of all the ambiance is great. Feels like you could be in London or New York. In a good way. But still maintains that local flavor.",1
4376638,4,Amazing food and quantity as well. Better than the once in northern Virginia even.,1
3311720,5,"I just drove off the lot with a beautiful new Toyota Rav 4 and I couldn't be more pleased with the car and service. My salesmen was Matt F. He was an absolute gentlemen throughout the process. Having been both knowledge and professional about the product, Matt made identifying the right car for me easy and painless. 

Mok the Sales Manager really impressed. Not only did he help me meet my budgetary needs, he also got me out at a reasonable time. My patience is thin and Mok was able to see that and got this deal done quickly. I shall return once my lease is up. 

Kudos to the GM and the leadership team for creating a culture that people feel comfortable with.",1
3566597,4,"Went on a Thursday night while visiting Philly, mostly because we had a restaurant.com gift certificate.  

The food (crab cakes and filet mignon) were both delicious, but be careful - the spiciness of the sauce on the crab cakes caught me off guard!  The martinis were delicious, especially when they became twice the size later in the evening.  

Overall, it felt like a typical gay restaurant...nothing unexpected, but friendly staff and good food aplenty.",1
2230860,5,We went for a late lunch /early dinner. It was our first time dining here.  Started with fried pickles which were very good then the Cuban sandwich and the inside out burger both with garlic fries. Awesome!! Ended our meal with fried Oreo and ice cream. Super! Great little place. You won't be disappointed.,1
2345555,4,"Had great lunch; crab and avocado salad was stunning and overflowing with prime clump crab.  Friend had Panini so large he took home half (it came with salad). Groupon made the deal excellent.
The service was friendly and kept us informed admitting she made an input error causing delay.  Unsweetened ice tea was real tasty and always refreshed,
But for lunch, get a smaller menu to serve quicker  I don't have over an hour every day to leisurely lunch.  Fast casual.  Fratelli's has the food quality; they need to focus.  Too many choices.",1
6100081,4,"Got a cheese pizza, cheese fries and cheesesteak! Cheese pizza was good, kids liked it! It was thin and sweet. Cheese fries were okay, thinking maybe it would have been better fresh but we got the takeout so it wasn't that great once we got back. Just wanted more of a melted consistency with the cheese and it could have been also crispier, they were a bit soggy. The cheesesteak was good, had better. The bread was too thick and maybe caused the cheesesteak to be a little dry. They have pickles, hot peppers and sweet peppers that are complimentary which was nice and helped add flavor. In all, not a horrible meal!",1
1670034,5,Absolutely fantastic. I've tried a good selection of their sausage and meat pies and they're always outstanding. Definitely worth checking out.,1
5913666,3,"I had high hopes for this place considering the previous reviews and my friends' recommendation.

Overall: it was okay. The server was friendly but she seemed extremely confused the entire time. We had no silverware and didn't eat out salads for 15minutes. We probably could have asked way earlier, but it also gave us an idea of how attentive the wait staff is. 

The food was good, but the flavors weren't anything special. Standard comfort food to fill your stomach at a reasonable price. Everything we ordered was covered in mounds of cheese (not complaining about too much cheese) and a lot of sauce. It was so filling that we all took home half of our meals and had it the next day for lunch.

We finished the meal with cannoli which was really good!",1
6819149,5,"Awesome, HUGE bar! 

cheap drinks and a hilariously awesome house band. Plenty of pools tables and places to sit. Pretty ideal bar for me!",1
1117040,5,"My lady and I absolutely loved the food here for Sunday brunch! What a fantastic choice in lovely Manayunk on a snow blanketed early December Sunday morning.

We ordered a variety of dishes to share and had half a dish to bring home, so portion sizes here definitely were more than enough for two.

First up was the Avacado toast, delicious! Was a bit of overkill in hindsight, but if you're more than 2, 4 people could share this easy when you consider the size of the plates.

Next up was our brunch platters, I had the frittata which still is making my mouth water writing about it a week later! Layered bacon on the bottom of a hot cast iron skillet with spinach, egg, potato and asparagus! So excellent.

This brunch truly brings back treasured memories that in Covid times I sorely miss. Hope the business and staff is hanging in there",1
4758300,4,"One family is a good place to go to if you're looking for  authentic Korean food..  Prob the best I've tried in the Tampa Bay area,  although I haven't been to many.  I did,  however,  live in VA with countless Korean restaurants so my expectations were high.  I went with my big family,  but were able to fit 12 people comfortably around a wooden table with benches.   Service was fast,  food overall was decent - good.   We ordered a bunch of items and shared family style: chicken wings (decent),  seafood pancake (not that good IMO),  bibimbap (yummy,  have to get it in the stone pot!),  Bulgari and kalbi (yummy),  japchae (decent). All in all it was a good experience,  a little pricey for Korean food that I'm used to but wouldn't mind returning for Korean food fix!",1
1379341,4,"Drove thru here to try the pizza. 

They have a selection of pizzas, sandwiches, salads, fries, sodas and shaved ice. 

 I ordered the meatball pizza and my buddy ordered the cheese. 

The pizzas were served quick. 

Both were thin crust pizzas slightly larger than. Personal size pizza. The ingredients seemed fresh and were ample to be flavorable. 

We both enjoyed our pizzas

At only $5 to $7 per pizza this is a very reasonable price. It's definitely a place you can take the family and order everyone the item of their choice without breaking the bank.",1
1496362,5,Absolutely phenomenal breakfast! The bananas foster waffles are amazing. Everything I've eaten here has been great.,1
466336,5,"Oh my, I was so happy to see The Bean Bar Co. parked in my neighborhood on a gloomy Saturday morning.

Wow, perfect timing! I walked up to their Coffee Bar/Truck and ordered a fun festive Xmas drink. Xmas Cookie Crumble Latte. That really made me happy and hyper for the whole day. 

They have many coffees and teas and breakfast danishes and breakfast sandwiches. 

They also love dogs and you can ask for a pup cup for your fur baby! 

They accept cash, credit, and Apple Pay for your convenience.

During the week, they are at Epperson Ranch Neighborhood in Wesley Chapel, and this weekend, lucky me,  they were right there where I live close enough for walking distance. I hope they are there every weekend. It probably won't be the case, but when they are, I'll be right there.  I suppose I can drive to Epperson Ranch, but walking is even more fun. The simple things, ya know!",1
3510318,3,"The layout of this place wastes a ton of space and also makes the tables awkwardly close together.  The bar area that looked uncomfortable to eat at and some sofa bar seating eats up over half of the space.  Other than that, it's another new place at La Encantada, so it's where all the people who... have to be at another new place at La Encantada... go.  So make reservations and bring your too-cool-for-Tucson attitude.

Fortunately the food was ridiculously good for another Tucson restaurant trying too hard to be upscale.  I've never been served a bigger portion of fish at a restaurant before and it was tasty.  A great option for seafood.",1
3307504,5,"Went back on another Saturday, around 10am and there were much more options. Staff is quick with orders even though there were a lot of people. Lavender bagel w/ vanilla honey cream cheese was nice (and definitely worth trying) but the togashi bagel w/ scallion lime cream cheese was AMAZING (new favorite!).",1
443838,5,"I can't think of a more perfect restaurant. Everything was outstanding- food, ambience and service",1
4386102,4,"I am not a beer person. I don't really like it as much as other drinks, but this place has such a wide variety of options, I always find something new I like. I'm definitely a fruity beer type of person and love their Belgium Lambic Peach beer. I also like their ciders, I try a new one and it's really because the staff is very knowledgeable in the beer stocks they have. Went here to play games for happy hour, watch a football game, and just to hang out with friends, all three events were perfect for this place. They have it all in a great location.",1
3697882,4,"It's a chain, but with that being said, I wasn't expecting too.  My fiancé's burrito was very good and I liked the chips. I also liked my margarita.  The service was quick and we enjoyed sitting on the patio and people watching on broadway.",1
2934859,5,"Excellent!  Found this place on yelp and was not disappointed.  Everything came out as a small dish and was hearty and delicious.  We had the meatballs, beat salad and the uovo pizza.   All were fabulous.  We were early for our reservation so we say at the chefs table; ie bar behind the cooks.  So enjoyed watching them prepare all of the delicious meals.  Great spot to eat",1
1810499,4,"We ordered green tea puff and strawberry shortcake.

I love their desserts, however it's pricey. 

The customer service is okay but price is something that gets on my nerves.",1
6233909,5,I stopped in without an appointment and the team was willing to take my son's truck that day.  Great job on the detail and reasonably priced.,1
2863262,5,"I was just coming from another salon that disappointed me a LOT: My hair was orange, & bc they were past closing time, the stylist didn't even blow dry my hair! Ugh, I literally needed help. I walked in without an appointment & they almost weren't goin to take me in, but Dillon made my night & saved me and my hair! The entire staff were friendly, but Dillon is amazing!! Even though my hair has a long way to go to get corrected to what I want it to look eventually lol, he took out the orange and other crazy colors out of my hair and made it softer and evenly toned. He went above and beyond my expectations, so I'm definitely a happy customer who will be back! Thanks so much!!",1
568806,4,"I must have driven  past this invisible place scores of times since it is way back of the Palladium parking lot, just south of the Thornton gas station.  But trying it is an obligation to maintain my coverage of all West Tampa eateries.  Also the Yelp reviews alerted  me to some inconsistencies, the lack of AC and the need for patience or calling ahead.  I wisely called ahead and my order was ready when I arrived 25 minutes later on a Friday pm.  And that
minimized the wait in record heat. So my informed expectations  were met.
   Yelp reviews also alerted me to some good deals on authentic Mexican dishes.  Let me commend the BBQ & chorizo tacos, the even better steak quesadillas and the wonderful mexican-style ceviche served in a cup like a cold, chunky soup with ample shrimp and fish and well-seasoned lime/cilantro infused broth.  Also available with octopus added.  
   Fair warning that these are not Taco Bell style tacos...no sour cream, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, guac. or crispy shells.  You get flat tortilla with well seasoned meat and cilantro (unless  you ask that  it be omitted.  Then you can add lime and green or hot red salsa.
This is a very good takeout if you   plan ahead.",1
1315941,4,"Husband and I went to Sabrina's while we were in town visiting a friend. We put our names on the list and waited 20 or so minutes (they told us it would be 30). The space inside is large but tight--they pack people in in there, which I don't mind in a breakfast joint. The menu has lots of options, the waiter recommended the huevos rancheros or the stuffed French toast. None of us got the French toast but we saw lots of others eating it and it looked quite decadent. Huevos rancheros were good and spicy. I got a burger with fries, good stuff. My husband ordered an omelet with lox. They forgot the lox, so the waiter took it back and they made him a new one. They ended up still charging him for the full omelet, which I thought was not a good way to treat customers. He had to wait 10-15 minutes while we were enjoying our hot food to get what he ordered. I think they should have comped the lox even though he ultimately got it. They lost a star for that.",1
3021375,5,Best gumbo and jambalaya in town! Can't compare to anywhere else. Super cheap and amazing food. A New Orleans must.,1
1428404,5,"The R+O special was great and HUGE. Half would be a normal sized sandwich. But the hush puppies. Get all the hush puppies. I got carry out - ordering & pick up was super quick, easy, convenient. There's also a drive thru daiquiri bar around the corner which happens to pair perfectly with take out. Definitely returning!",1
2724101,5,"The food here is very good. The fish tacos are highly recommended to order. Everything is nicely seasoned and the food is very fresh. If you want good chipotle like foods, this place is the best for it on University.",1
4105788,5,Great tacos and dog friendly.   You can actually sit inside with your dog and enjoy tacos.     Which is especially great in the summer and winter.     Bring you lap top and you enjoy a taco or 2 with you pup!   Amazing!,1
19194,4,Really great atmosphere. It reminded me of a diner. The service was great and the food came out fast. The cheese curds are amazing. The double cheeseburger meal is well priced and you'll leave full. Looking forward to coming back and trying the frozen custard!!,1

4674282,3,"weird.  I was certain I'd already reviewed this location,  but I guess not.

It's DQ?  What can I say?  You already know what you're getting, right?  

It looks like there are some ongoing service issues at this location, but I'e not experienced them.  I've always had decent service.  Not exceptional ,but decent and friendly.  I'll take it.",1
6381460,3,"Love coming to this location for a sweet savory breakfast. I like bringing my friends here before they head home back to new York. It's a few miles from Amtrak so a great pitstop. The servers are friendly and will to make changes to the dishes if need be. Good place, just advoid Sunday mornings or afternoons. The church family crowds are huge and the wait is long.",1
2417159,5,"Cute little cafe in the area with a welcoming atmosphere and staff!  It's a pretty small building so it's nice and cozy.  As we were seated, little squares of cinnamon crumb cake were placed on the table.  A treat to taste while searching the menu for a meal.  

I ended up going with the spinach fontina omelette with potatoes on the side.  The eggs were a decent portion, stuffed with spinach, roasted red peppers, and fontina cheese!  The breakfast potatoes were seasoned well and I recommend adding onions if you enjoy them.  It really hit the spot and was perfectly filling.  My friend got the avocado hash with cheddar, potatoes, tomatoes, and two poached eggs on the side. 

For my second time here, I tried the cowboy hash.  This combined their rustic red potatoes, onions, green peppers, bacon, and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese.  I decided to get my eggs scrambled on the side!  It was the perfect-portioned meal and kept me full for most of the day!  It also came with an Apple Walnut Muffin.  This muffin was perfectly crispy and moist, with raisins and sugar on top.  Really hit the spot!",1
1210761,5,"5 stars for the value. Place is really cheap for the quantity and quality. My girlfriend and I normally just split one entree and substitute the rice for lo mein and that is more than enough for both of us. Our favorite is the jalapeno chicken (spelled halopino on their menu). Highly recommend this place if you are looking for cheap but delicious americanized chinese. Authentic does not mean the same thing as good, contrary to what all the hipsters are trying to tell us. Because this place is semi-authentic and absolutely delicious. (and I've been to China)

Oh yeah and they do a really good job with making it spicy if you request.",1
5169978,5,Food was excellent.  Service was even better. Kevin and Becky were great. I had the cod and my partner had the scallops. Both were fantastic. We split the chocolate torte and blood orange sorbet for desert. Delicious.,1
1841609,5,Favorite Korean restaurant by far. The atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming and always friendly company. Food is authentic and always great,1
3763299,5,I found everything I needed at bobs to furnish my new house!! I was helped by Tish. She was an excellent knowledgeable sales person. Great personality and I was very pleased. The store is amazing. Furniture selection is great. Clean and neat. And the ice cream bar in the back was a great touch for kids  while parents shop!!  I've already recommended my good friend there after my purchase today and told her to ask for Tish!!! Very satisfied.,1
2582983,5,"We're recent Nashville transplants and can walk here from our house. I'm glad we finally visited! Cocktails were well balanced and strong-- my preference. We got the fried green tomatoes which had a nice balance of tang, savory, and a little kick. I was in the mood for burger-- and it was among best I've ever had! We'll seasoned, very juicy, but we'll cooked. Delicious bun, with light toast. Their ice cream was thick, custardy, and good enough to be stand alone dessert. Overall, great dinner out, and our fav among Sylvan Park, or even Nashville, that we've had so far.",1
1780338,5,"This review is a little crazy because I don't drink or like coffee at all. 

Why do I come here you ask? Their bubble tea! Oh, I've had literally every flavor bubble tea they have. They have almost the same consistency of a smoothie but a bit creamier. I had to get used to the tapioca pearls but they became addictive after a while. I can recommend all their bubble tea flavors they are all my favorite. So if you in the area I definitely recommend the bubble tea from here. 

Besides their amazing bubble tea; They have great service and the coffee house is very clean.",1

807484,4,"Love it here on Saturday nights.  Nice place to lounge.  Amazing band.  Drinks are good.  They play salsa, bachata, a little bit of diversity thrown in the mix.  This is a lovely place to catch up with friends and have a good time.  A lot of places in Tampa have a young crowd.  This place is older crowd 25 and up.",1
877689,3,"I really enjoyed my latest visit here. The waiter was a spry young man named Clark who was fast and efficient, I only have one complaint: we asked for more breadsticks several times and never received them. I ordered the chicken Alfredo as I always do and it was hot and delicious, my personal favorite is the chicken gnocchi soup. The price range is about 12-30 per meal depending on what you order, but the portions are fair. In conclusion I will continue to go to The Olive Garden for the Alfredo, the breadsticks, and the soup.",1
1871650,4,Well it's as good as they say! We had delivery of pizza salad fries chicken fingers. All were very tasty.,1
1465448,5,I had an excellent experience. Everything was done over the internet and email responses were rapid. I got a proof of my DVD within days of the order and the finished product was better than anything I could have done. Downloading my own artwork was impossible and I guess I paid for that but still happy with the final results. A little pricey but the reorders will be better. I dealt with Mike W. and Alex J. and they were always helpful. A lot of proof reading issues on my part and still got DVDs on schedule.,1
5399690,3,"It's still on it's way! It's as honest and fair as I can make it. Don't worry. If you love the place, it's clear why you do... If it's your first shot, you kinda' have to be in the right frame of mind ;)",1
512974,4,"Not your typical traditional taco joint but still good! The al pastor is a little dry but not bad. The asada is the best. Very pricey for tacos though. 3 dollars for a pastor taco is ridiculous especially since I usually eat 5-6 tacos, I recommend getting a burrito, more bang for your buck. The hot salsas are good. The horchata is very delicious, you can tell they make it fresh.",1
1526021,5,"Pizza is great. Service was much better . Each time we go the staff shows improvement. Think they are over the opening jitters and should be clear sailing. 

I am not from Chicago so not a pizza know it all . For my money this is one if the best 3-4 pizza places in town. To all the people from Chicago who criticize Indy pizza just remember that deep dish is NOT pizza . It is Chicago trash!

Jockamo's is great pizza !!!!",1
6959402,5,I decided to try a different nail salon because the one I was going to build up too much acrylic oh my natural nails and they looked extremely Lumpy.

4966765,5,"I love this place. If you're new to Cajun food this is the place to go. They offer samples before that you can try before orderjng.  I was raised in New Orleans and still  go there all the time so I know what this food is supposed to taste like.

You just cannot go wrong at the Lost Cajun.",1

5889338,5,"One of my favorite things about Saba was the atmosphere. The food is delicious, and the restaurant is spacious and beautifully decorated. It's great for visiting with friends because the restaurant is not too loud and you feel comfortable and casual. All of the food was light, fresh, and flavorful. Some highlights of our meal were the blue crab hummus, the roasted chicken, and a side of charred Napa cabbage. The salatim were tasty, but may skip them next time and have an additional hummus or try more of the small plates instead. Worth a trip!",1

2176104,4,"Oh joy - you Yelpers rock.  This place is off the ""beaten path,"" tucked into what seems like a small side street off a main street, and it has no huge awning or welcoming entrance to say, ""Hello, Philly, we are here with great coffee!""  Thank goodness for Yelpers.

Also, the menu is pretty small but focuses on the beans.  YES.  The menu does not identify the almond milk latte possibility, but oh yes, it's possible.  The beans here are beautiful.  In iced almond latte format... I can say that I consumed it in less than a minute... no joke.  It was that good.  Well... give a coffee-a-holic connoisseur some good brew, and... well, thank goodness I bought a bag of beans for the home brewing.  This place is delicious.

The staff are nice, unassuming, patient and helpful.  The focus is the coffee, as it should be.

The space is beautiful and has a calmer feeling than most coffee houses/ shops.

Plenty of items to order for food, but, the food isn't the most health conscious, vegan or gluten-free friendly.  Just saying.  Good looking choices, but, really, however good they are, I would spend all my money on their coffee.  So good!",1
6137196,5,Indy Cakes did a magnificent job on our cake and cupcakes for our wedding. Jill and her staff were so accommodating and the cake and cupcakes guest said was delicious. I guess it was because they ran out of cake and cupcakes we never got any except our initial slice. Thank you for all your service for me and my wife for our special day.,1
4822978,5,"This was my first time going to Akira and I was a bit confused by the whole set-up, however, once we explained to the waitress that we were there for the all you can eat sushi bar we were seated in the correct section (the other section was for hibachi and if you were interested in ordering from the menu). 

Ordering was similar to ordering from traditional sushi places - you simply mark what you would like to order on the paper and place it at the end of the table. All of the sushi was fresh and delicious and I particularly liked the variety of sushi and appetizers offered. The sushi was brought out quickly and the waitstaff was very attentive.

I was extremely excited to see red bean ice cream on the menu as it is somewhat difficult to find. Overall, I think the sushi of appropriate quality for the price and I would definitely go back!",1

6575595,3,"I came here for lunch with my boss and we ordered of the lunch menu.  We were immediately sat even though the dinning room was full.  I order the fried eggplant and mozzarella sandwich with a side salad.  The salad was delicious...I wish all salads were created equal.  The sandwich was ok.  I would not serve it with bread and maybe a more bold sauce.  Wouldn't order the sandwich again.  But, I do hope to eat dinner here one day, I heard it was great.",1
3140562,3,"It was late and so the staff was probably a little over it. I think this may be one of those places that's overrated. Most of what I was interested in was also not available which was a huge bummer. I'll probably try going one other time, earlier and see if that's a better experience. The cornbread also needed a lot of help! No flavor and wasn't cooked properly in my opinion.",1

So, my experience with floating started with mild curiosity.  First couple times were a bit awkward and disorienting.  But, I felt results immediately.  Mostly physical, better sleep and it eased my low-back pain considerably.

I'm a little more experienced and comfortable with floating now, and I have a monthly membership at Float Nashville.  I've been going once or twice a month and I have to say, there is nothing like floating.  It is a unique experience.  And I'm finding that the more I do it, the more I like it.  I like how I feel.  My tension and stress are greatly diminished.  I feel lighter and more present.  I am a floater for life.  Try it, I think you'll be glad you did.",1

If you're still thirsty you could also opt for the big toad, an up-sized frogarita...as far as pizza goes, the fox firkin is delish and if you're not feeling adventurous the regular cheese slice is a good option too... the catch o the day salad is also good if you're trying to go healthy-ish. Frog& Firkin is also one of the few spots that give a yelp check in offer although you can't avail the offer unless it's hardcopy :(

There are a few $4 tapas during happy hour ( 5-7 I think) and $20 pitchers of sangria. We had  a couple of those, the sangria along with the beets, octopus, pork belly and salt cod. Everything was delivered quickly, service was attentive and very helpful. As someone mentioned earlier the music might be a little loud (but good) inside but I'm 65 and most things are too loud these days LOL.",1

I've been ""playing"" golf on and off since I was 26 and I turn 50 soon. I've been able to score as low as 39 for nine holes and 90 a couple of times for 18 holes. I've never been able to drive the ball with any consistency or much distance. Now, after my second lesson with Golf Galaxy, I can say that I can finally drive the ball. I had my lesson with Lee about 8 months ago but never got to the range to apply what I learned.  I hit the first 30 balls with the driver tonight for the most part straight and averaging around 200 yards. 
The golf swing is a fairly simple concept. You take the club back on the same plane it starts....with a driver it's around 45 degrees. Normally I would raise the club steep and take it too far back. The 45 degree angle drill with a plow stake got me on plane instantly (never hit it once on the way down) and by doing so it automatically shortened my swing to no more than a 3/4 swing. Many pros say that you can hit the ball pretty much as far with a 3/4 swing as you can by going parallel or past. The first lesson got me to hit down on irons instead of scooping. The second lesson got me to swing on the same 45 degree plane I started on instead of changing the angle to steep as I take the club back, not readjusting and hitting a lot of ground instead of the sweet spot of the driver like I did for the first time tonight. Out of 4 pros I've worked with in 24 years, Leigh Taylor is the only one who has helped my game.....and fast.",1
3367973,5,"Located on the first floor of the Renaissance Tampa Hotel at International Plaza is Pelagia Trattoria, a delightfully high-end Mediterranean / Italian masterpiece.

As you enter the Renaissance Hotel, walk towards the main reception desk, and then wind around the hallway back towards the restaurant. Pelagia Trattoria faces the inner courtyard of the hotel where you'll have a full view of the open kitchen, while seated in a spectacular dining area complete with hand-glazed tiles, custom ironwork, and bright, jewel-toned, blown-glass light fixtures to enhance the elegant Mediterranean atmosphere. 

Executive Chef Andrew Basch and his team have created a unique cuisine that changes with each season, offering only top quality, fresh ingredients: the finest beef, seafood, veal, lamb, and hand-made pastas and pizzas.

My client was staying at the Renaissance, and we met at Pelagia for a quiet business lunch. We were seated along the windows facing the courtyard, and drinks arrived promptly along with a basket of fresh breads, a small dish of olive tapenade, and a section of fresh creamery butter.

I ordered the open-faced grilled grouper sandwich and my client had the ricotta and asparagus ravioli. We both added a small Caesar salad, and started our business discussions.

My client was intrigued when I asked his OK before checking in on Yelp and taking a picture of my sandwich, and before long we were chatting away about the wonders of everyone's favorite on-line review website. I've since learned that he and his wife have signed up as new Yelpers, and before long I am sure we'll be seeing some great reviews out of New York City.

So at the end of the day it was a terrific new restaurant find, a great meal, a couple of new Yelpers.........Oh yes, and a nice new contract!!!!",1
1877070,5,This place is awesome. You cannot beat the filet special on Tuesdays. Best deal in town. Hope they keep it around. Very Extensive beer list. They seem to manage a full house very well. Service more or less is always good. Try the boneless wings cooked hermanaki style and you won't regret it.,1
6551020,4,"We went for the 1st time today and have already said we'd be back. There was a wait (about 20min) when we arrived, but it was worth it. Everyone was friendly and the service was good. I will say that the ""waiting"" area is definitely on the small side. 

I got the avocado Benedict and a side of fresh berries. While the berries didn't come out w the rest of our food, our waitress brought them over without me saying anything to her. My friend got the French toast sampler (strawberry stuffed, cinnamon toast crunch, peanut butter/banana/Nutella stuffed) and a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich; yes, he was starving. He said that everything was good! The only complaint I have about the food is that the breakfast potatoes were a little on the bland side, but nothing that salt and pepper couldn't fix. 

Looking forward to our next trip there!",1
598573,4,"We've been a patient of Dr. Ashley since 2015.

Location: Convenient (Downtown next to Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center)

Waiting Area: Uncomfortable seating, especially for bigger people, and can be very full at times. Aesthetically it could use some help.

Staff: The CNAs/MAs are great. The office staff isn't very helpful. They are split between Dr. Ashley-Cothern and Dr. Hernandez and give a feeling that they are overwhelmed and inept at times due to failure to follow through (call backs, follow-ups, paperwork [i.e. FMLA]). Also make sure you check your deductibles & copays and know what they are. The office staff aren't alway accurate about those.

Dr. Ashley-Cothern seems rushed at times. However, if you ask questions she will answer them well.

We have shown up early for an appointment, then had wait 1 hour, but we told why (an emergent situation at the hospital). We've also experienced

Dr. Ashley has cancelled on us due to emergent situations. It's super annoying, inconvenient, and infuriating. HOWEVER, when we needed her (i.e. birthing our child), Dr. Ashley was there for us too.",1
3664041,5,"The owner is the sweetest. She's so cute and honestly reminded me of a actual Korean family. The restaurant gives such a homie feel. There isn't a open grill like other kbbq but it's okay with me. If you don't want to drive all the way to Philly, it's worth it. The food was good and the seafood pancake is really amazing. It is a lot thicker than other ones I had in the past so prepare your stomach to be full by the time your meal comes out. I will come back for sure to try other meals.",1

2150313,4,"I'm giving Peggy O's four stars.  This rating is higher than the food deserves...but the staff friendliness, fun atmosphere, DT Palm Harbor location and good live music on a Thursday night all add up to more than the sum of the parts. 
We ordered the day's special: two-for-one fish and chips.  They came out fast and hot and looked right (see photos). Portion size was great. The coleslaw and fries were good. The fish batter was golden and crisp and not too thick.  But the fish...something was up w the fish. 
This is the second time I've had it here, and both times I noticed something about the texture of it.  It has a nearly gelatinous mouthfeel that disintegrates quickly...the opposite of ""firm"" and it has virtually no flavor.  I asked our server what kind of fish they use. He told me it is Swai...a Southeast Asian catfish.  Go ahead and google it...there are a lot of opinions about this fish.   All in all, I don't think Swai should ever be used for fish n chips.  However Peggy O's is still a good place to relax, get a bite and hang out.   I like it...just not their fish n chips.",1
3499886,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants in St. Louis. They always have great quality food. I recommend the wraps with a side of smiley fries - which are actually better than their regular fries. And if it's your birthday you get a free root beer float! The toasted rav appetizers are to die for and I love the pretzel sticks too. I highly recommend this place!,1
6946557,4,"The review is from a previous visit for an oil change several months back. When I near or exceed the engine oil date/mileage and I just need a quick oil change...this the place I go and get on the road. Never a long wait. 

They have two drive thru bays, as you pull in they'll look your information up (via license plates) and as if you was the same service and get to work,  In the meantime, they'll check your your lights and air filter..they'll offer to replace any that needs to. As they are replacing your oil, they'll also top off your windshield washer fluid too. The staff is always helpful and the service is very quick. 

The one advantage this place has over other places (i.e., JiffyLube), you stay in your vehicle...no need to get out and go to the waiting room. As with other drive-thru oil change shops, they offer a free wash.",1
2849896,4,I love coming here because I get in and out.   Lately the stylist turn over has been high so you never know what you're going to get.  Jinette the owner colored my hair and I loved it!!!

If I can't find a spot to park I go somewhere else but not by choice.,1
6243942,3,"Love LPQ! When I lived in NYC, I would go there all the time and the food is amazing. First time trying this place is Philly. Monday afternoon, slow time of the day. One more table. Two servers, plus one trainee. Selection of desserts was very limited, but we choose few pastries that they had left.
 Pain su a chocolat (chocolate croissant) was cold, dry and hard. as well Pain aux Raisins (pastry with Raisins) and Choco chip cookie. I was only asked if I would like a Organic Butter Brioche to be toasted. 
Large Latte arrived in a cracked cup but still tasty and good flavor. In NYC, they practice leaving a bottle of water on the table, but not in Philly. Don't know if service practice has changed or what.",1

I was in Franklin for a week for work and was able to get delicious, healthy paleo dinners (the entree and two side special for $11). The brussels sprouts at the deli counter are AMAZING. I also had the salmon and the butternut squash salad, both were good. As with any Whole Foods, they have everything you could ever want and good service. They were handing out delicious dark chocolate truffles at the front door.",1
5292415,4,"A great little pizza/beer source hidden in Tampa Heights.   We had one of their loaded variations with lots of meats, veggies and cheese.....light on sauce, great on flavor
Also a surprisingly extensive inventory of craft beers and ciders to-go...all at reasonable prices.  Parking is at a premium on the street, and soon they hope to add draft beer for on-site quaffing, emphasizing local brews.

We also had a great experience of customer service/concern.  After we paid with credit card, adding a modest tip, somehow the tip input to MasterCard was the same amount  as the total for pizza & beer, thereby nearly doubling the charge.  However the manager spotted the error and called at home to explain the error and offer an immediate refund or gift card.  I took the gift card as a form of ""tab"" for when they get their beer service approval.",1
236065,4,"We stumbled upon this place after a long day of drinking and dancing at the Jazz Fest.  The restaurant has a nice decor and a comfortable and classy feel to it.  Our waiter was great and super helpful in helping us all decide what to order.  We all ordered different Creole favorites and everyone was extremely happy with the food.  The prices are great for the quality of food as well.  Our dinner did take a very long time with extremely long waits between courses.  We never complained, but fortunately our waiter was very apologetic and even brought us two desserts on the house -- both of which were delicious.  I definitely recommend this place for a nice, but still affordable, dinner out in the French Quarter.",1
5022749,5,"The beads of the Rosary slid between my fingers and prayers silently flew from my lips as I came upon a beautiful church. Its windows were clear and devoid of the stained glass one would expect, but still, what a lovely, red-bricked sanctuary in which to render unto God thanks and praise, I thought. I made my way through the entrance, preparing to make the Sign of the Cross when - lo and behold - gleaming vats of ale! Silver beacons of glorious grog! 

Sweet manna from heaven! 

God blessed me with my daily bread and much, much more the day I found St. Joseph. The Smoked Tri Tip Beef Sandwich satisfied my hunger and I about died when I tried the fries; luckily, the aroma alone could lure Lazarus back from  the dead! I confess, the chapel-cum-restaurant could turn you into a glutton, but an indulgence here will only make a man more penitent than ever after trying the fare. 

The only regret I had was not coming upon this cathedral of cuisine midweek for the Growler special. A number of Seasonal Draughts tempted my pallet, but I suppose I needed something to look forward to the next time I came to St. Joseph Brewery. I planned on being much more prayerful in the future. 

Much more prayerful, indeed.",1

It was the most tender steak and so full of flavor. We finished our meal with flan which also was the best flan I've ever had very creamy and tasty! Overall our experience was beyond exceptional. Our waitress (Taylor) was very attentive, sweet and went above and beyond to make our dinner enjoyable. We have been to the El Charro location in downtown a few times and the service at the Oracle location is far better. Our experiences at the downtown location have not been pleasant. Horrible service each time and no care for their customers. Downtown managers should take notes from the Oracle location! They are doing everything right!

Checked into an upper floor room yesterday to discover that someone else's key card was laying in the room, along with some of their trash.

Housekeeping responded promptly and made things right, but misses like this are tiresome and make you wonder how well anything is being cleaned.",1

2260565,3,"We got this tour for free since we went to a vacation presentation that is similar to a timeshare. However, I was expecting a lot more for the advertised price. The bus driver made us walk across Canal street to be picked up in the middle of the street, even though he ended up coming by our hotel about 5 minutes later. He did not wait for anyone to sit down upon entering the bus, senior citizens were no exception and I hurt myself trying to sit down while moving since I just had arm surgery. The driver, Dino, was definitely driving the bus ""like he stole it""; we were bumping and rocking all over the place in the French Quarter.

Now, once we finished picking everyone up, we slowed down and the tour started to look up. Dino was a nice guy and funny; however, I would recommend him speaking more professionally. He used ebonics when he spoke and told us the history with a lot of slang. He told us some bars were a good place to take your boo, he described old duels with ""yo dude, we just need to squash this, dude; ya know what I saying"". when I go on a tour, I just expect a level of professionalism, that I felt this tour lacked.

I also felt too much time was spent in the ninth ward and we barely covered the garden district. I would rather see a lot of the garden district over the ninth ward. However, it is nice to see the ninth ward, since most of us would never travel there without this tour.

I did enjoy the cemetery tour and I feel this is where Dino did the best. He was very funny during the cemetery tour and I did learn a lot.

Overall, for free, I did not waste anything. However, I would be disappointed if I spent $45 a person for this tour. If you want to see the ninth ward, take this tour. However, there are other tours I would recommend without spending $45 a person.",1

Usually this type of store have clearance section, but windy moon quilts did not have any which kinda disappointed me.

3305526,5,"I am trying to recall the last time that I so enjoyed a dining experience.  The ambience and noise level were optimal.  The service was attentive (but not overbearing) and friendly.  I had the Duck Rangoon as a starter and felt as if I had to restrain myself from licking the plate.My wife had the flash fried Brussel Sprouts, something that is not a personal favorite.  They were truly amazing.  I had the sea bass as my main and it was absolutely perfect.  The confluence of the fish, bok choy, broccoli and béchamel produced a flavor sensation unlike anything i have ever experience.  My wife had the lobster roll which was far better than any that I have ever tried.  No kidding - Boston and Maine included, this thing is off the charts.  Portions were generous and the presentation was exquisite.

If I have one (very small) complaint, it would be parking.  The neighborhood parking is a bit tight, so the addition of valet parking would be a plus.

Fives stars and then some.  We will be back.",1

There is just a romantic memory that I had with that Starbucks in the east coast. It was raining out, you could smell the wet rain as it dripped from my clothes. I order some coffee and sit down. I start reading the news paper and as I was reading here came this lady politely interrupting me to serving me some coffee. ""Here your coffee sir"" the lady says with a smile on her face.

I made a reservation pretty early and we got this really nice table downstairs where there was only one other table. It was really nice, low lighting, comfy booth with pillows, very intimate and fun. The only awkward thing was that people would come down to go to the bathroom from time to time.

We split a pitcher of the red sangria, which was amazing and the waiter heard us debating between the white and red so he brought us a glass of white on the house which was super nice!

Everything we got was really good, artistically displayed, and it was fun to try all different dishes.

We got the...
idiazabal and mahon cheese,
the gazpacho soup (so good!),
arugula salad (amazing), 
serrano wrapped figs (super), 
chicken brochettes (whatever sauce these were on was incredible),
spanish octopus (YUM), 
seabass (very tender), 
basquaise mussels (these were good, not my favorite, would skip next time),  
bomba rice (I would skip this next time too, it was good but not amazing)

6586222,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Elizabeth Johns and ended up buying my wedding dress here. My consultant was Ericka and she was lovely. When I made my initial phone call to schedule my appointment, I stated my preferred budget, which happens to be on the very low end of Elizabeth Johns. The lady on the phone (I don't recall her name) told me the price ranges very tactfully though and I appreciated that information upfront so I had realistic expectations.
When I arrived, Ericka had already set aside some dresses in my price range she thought I might like. At no point did she ever try to upsell me into something more expensive.
Ericka and all of the other ladies in the store were welcoming and positive, and I liked that we could take photos. When I said ""yes"" to the dress, the champagne was brought out and it was such a great moment!
The atmosphere is upscale and classy. I had a really great experience dress shopping at Elizabeth Johns and I can't wait until my dress arrives in the fall!",1

And it's fantastic. The asparagus is some of the best I've had. The ""lobster skins""--lobster + potato skins--are delish... And the salmon over crab hash is great. It's beautifully prepared with uber fresh ingredients. Living up to the name... We'll be back, next time w a bottle of wine!",1
56622,4,"Pros: The food was great. They served big portions for everyone. We all were able to share from each other's plates and still feel full. The thai iced tea was yum! It's BYOB. 
Cons: The restaurant was very crowded and there wasn't much room for my large party of 7 people. We came for dinner and most of the seafood items weren't available. They charge you if you bring your own beer though.",1
694309,5,"This is awesome spot to eat, drink and bowl!! We had the loaded tater tots and flatbread pepperoni pizza along with a pitcher of Abita Amber. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was excellent. They played good music and the service was friendly and quick! I would highly recommend going here to bowl. Keep in mind though it's a little pricy; it cost us roughly 60.00 an hour to bowl.",1
6292550,4,"First visit to Han Dynasty. Interesting place with large ceiling and good decor and huge bar w TV's. The food was excellent for Chinese. Our group likes spicy food and we got 8/10 on their scale which a little weak on spiciness. We felt at that level they had overdone the pepper flakes to compensate for the spiciness and they also provided spicy oil. We got the dan Dan noodles, chicken dry pot, mapo tofu, and wonton soup w chicken. The Dan Dan Noodles were a good start. The dry pot chicken had too many pepper flakes but was otherwise well done. The mapo tofu was also excellent, the saucy was not too runny and it was not overpowered by flakes as well. The soup was standard and also a good choice. Service was excellent but their table layout was weird. We sat in the middle of the entire place. 
We will definitely go again, very reasonable prices, and overall a good experience.",1
2155599,5,"My boyfriend surprised me with dinner here for our three year anniversary and everything from entering to dining was crazy cute and charming. I'm always a fan of dim lighting and rustic decor with a modern twist, and this place delivers. You definitely get a lounge feel here because of the bar area, and it's so beautifully presented. There's also a small outdoor seating area as well that comes equipped with an intimate fireplace. 

We were visiting from out of town, so we really depended on recommendations from our server to help navigate our appetites. We happened to arrive during their happy hour (M-F from 5-11, both drinks and apps!), so she recommended items from their HH menu as well as their regular one. 

What we ordered:
+ Patatas Bravas - red and sweet potatoes sautéed in spicy chili garlic aiol; SUPER DELICIOUS, as the heat from the sauce really compliments the sweet potatoes and adds that extra gusto to really make it stand out
+ Toasted Goat - roasted roma tomato and herb sauce with goat cheese and garlic crostini; my favorite of everything we ordered, simply because of how eclectic and different it was. It tasted like a tomato basil soup with a goat cheese punch at the end, and if you love goat cheese, then I'd recommend this dish. Comes with 5 pieces of crostini to dip or eat independently, your choice! 
+ Honey Lamb Pops - charbroiled lamb chops cooked in a teriyaki, honey, butter, shallot, and brown sugar sauce; the meat came in three fairly sized pieces and melts in your mouth, but the honey flavor was slightly overwhelming for me. However, this was my boyfriend's favorite and he was literally cleaning the bones of any trace of meat at an attempt to get one more bite each time

For two people our server recommended two dishes each, but we were pretty stuffed after these three - maybe because two of them were really starch heavy. We smelled their signature tiger prawns being cooked from our seats and the aroma almost had us ordering it, but we really couldn't handle anymore food. Wish we lived closer so we could try out more things!",1
926730,5,"If I were eating my last meal on Earth, raw oysters would definitely be one of the appetizers.  When my wife finally nagged me to make the 5 1/2 hour drive to New Orleans, Drago's immediately became a must stop during our culinary eating weekend.  My wife and I are BIG fans of the raw oysters but we had to stop at Drago's to try their much beloved chargrilled oysters.  We arrived at this location at 7 p.m. on Friday night and were quickly seated without any wait. As we walked by the open kitchen, where we saw the oysters getting shucked and grilled, our mouths began to water like a rabid canine.  

We ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters and a dozen of the raw oysters. I also ordered the grilled drum (similar to redfish) but the oysters were the reason we came.  The raw and chargrilled oysters arrived and we quickly noticed these oysters must have been hormone fed because they were gigantic.  The chargrilled oysters are as good as other reviewers say they are and lived up to our expectations.  

HOWEVER, we still loved the raw oysters more. That's because when you cook an oyster, you basically kill the natural flavors and they become whatever ingredient you put on them. In this case, they tasted like garlic, butter and wood fired smoke.  The sweet/salty brine and plumpness were gone from the chargrilled oysters. To us, it's like taking a piece of toro and chargrilling it.  Some things are meant to be eaten raw.  Thankfully, we were also able to enjoy the fantastic raw oysters.

As a footnote, the grilled drum was very good and would be a formidable star, if not for the brighter oyster star in this universe.",1

Be prepared to go on a weeknight or during non-holiday times so you can be sure that you won't have to fist fight your way to the good sales areas in middle.  You can get particularly good deals on hoodies and sweats and causal tees getting it all for $5-10 per piece.  The kids areas aren't much to be impressed by, however there's always good new baby clothes so you can stock up for all your breeding friends.",1
840029,3,"We arrived starving (our quoted wait time was probably off by 20 minutes  unfortunately) so I decided to use the free queso with a yelp check-in voucher. I have to say, it was AMAZING. Gooey, velveeta-y cheesy goodness. I ate so much I could barely put a dent in the Santa Fe Salad I ordered- I guess that's what you get for overeating on the app and arriving famished. From what I had, the salad was still pretty good. Very fresh.

While the service was spotty, I definitely would be down to try it out again.",1

The Soundwaves water park is a great addition to the hotel and you can go spend a day in the lazy river, or at the top of a water slide! The hotel is most pretty around Christmas because they put up all of the lights in the atriums and it looks so good. The hotel rooms are modern and clean and you have plenty of room to do things like work or play. The staff is so friendly and was there to help us when we needed it. In the end, Gaylord Opryland is a fantastic place to stay!",1

Well, many decades have passed and no mater where I have lived in the world, when coming back to Santa Barbara I never miss a trip to Joe's. With children going to UCSB the trip to Joe's has been more frequent lately. Took the youngest there Sunday morning, short wait, and as usual great clean food at a fair price. Eggs Benedict was perfect for me and my son had a Breakfast Sandwich, perfect! As for dinner, Joe's again does not disappoint. Stiff drinks, good food, fair prices(notice a theme for me here?)... Who could ask for more?",1
2288338,4,"Very nice bar area.  The crowd is a little older.  The food was pretty fantastic.  We had the French onion soup (which was top notch), buffalo chicken flatbread, Thai shrimp, green bean fries, burgers, sandwiches and the fish & chips.  All were high quality.  Drinks are a little pricey & they certainly need some fun drink specials.  They definitely need different sangria recipes.  

Our server was extremely helpful & pleasant.  Besides the less than adequate sangria, it was a pretty darn good experience.",1
4790581,3,"I decided on an early Sunday morning to try the cafe. It was just me so only had to wait between 5 and 10 minutes for a table. I realize that this establishment usually has a long line outside because of how small it is-there are maybe eight tables total. The music was great, the service too but the food was nothing to write home about. I had to look up what I ate; eggs Tuscan style and a single pancake -bland x 3.  

Since I go to restaurants primarily for the food, I don't plan to return to Jimmy J's. 4 stars for overall experience minus 1 star for the food (taste)= 3 stars.",1

I would highly recommended Mike Richardson to anyone looking to finance a home. With this being such a crazy market in our area Mike was quick to give us all the info he possibly could about how the market is working or fluctuating, and made it so that we could understand all of what he was saying with no confusion.

The place is clean and well decorated. Although there was some lingering of BBQ smell on clothes at departure, the vents in this place work. 

We ordered combo A and we had to pack up the leftovers.  The side dishes are standard. Nothing spectacular about them. Wish they had substituted the edamame for another traditional banchan side dish. 

Ordered a couple of bottles of Soju with our meal.

2585496,3,"First off as one who lives within a five minute walk from this place ( I can see the roof tops of my complex from the bar) I was excited to see Sea Dog move into this place six months ago after it sitting empty for many years.

 They have done an amazing job with the remodel and layout making it user friendly and welcoming for both diners and bar lovers. You have amazing water views from both bars and the open air feeling thru out the restaurant is very nice. 

Where they fall short though is on service and food. Menu is interesting but a little overpriced and there is nothing super exciting about the food verses what you can get at the beach bar restaurant across the channel from the Sea Dog. In my opinion this is just another beach bar/restaurant with a new look to it. My wife and I have been here over a dozen times since it opened late last year hoping it would win us over.  The service is sketchy and to me they should have ironed this issue out within a couple of months after opening.
I do suggest if your looking for a new place to try out to give them a chance, the ambience will win you over even if the food and service does not.",1

I usually get a torta with chorizo meat they season themselves and a few tacos. Is it so spicy it gives me a bit of heartburn? Yup. Do I keep on getting it because it tastes frikin awesome and is worth it? YUP! They even put napoles on the torta and cojita cheese yummm!

Probably the best cheesesteak in Philly.  The steak is incredibly juicy and the cheese and onions complement it perfectly.

One criticism would be the lack of seating.  We were lucky as the place was empty when we arrived.",1

Solid Italian hoagie. The pizza here is really good. Has a nice light thing tangy sauce. Very delicious. Crust is nice too. 

Cheesesteak meat is chopped really small, not my favorite method l(I'm somewhat of an expert) but still really yummy. Lots of gooey cheese and mushroom and onion on a nice soft roll. 

Overall very good experience, just what the doctor did not order!",1
4688129,5,"I really wish we had something similar to Cassis where I'm from, and even if there was I'm sure it would be a guaranteed 40 minute drive just for brunch. I was in St. Pete's visiting for the week and my cousin told me this was the spot to stop by downtown, so I did what any other tourist would do and went along with him.

We got a table outside because it wasn't overly hot/humid out yet. The hostess gave us menus and we glanced over them for brunch options. I don't remember our waiter's name but he was a more middle-aged gentleman and he did a phenomenal job at acquainting us to the menu. We started off with half a dozen oysters and the cheese plate, and for entrees I got the smoked salmon benedict while my cousin ended up with the quiche of the day. They also offered freshly squeezed pulp orange juice which we both agreed to get.

The oysters and cheese plate came out first and were both super fresh. Nothing like oysters at 11am, right? The combination of the freshly baked bread and some of the cheeses were insanely delicious, especially with the brie. Not long after, our brunch entrees came out and looked amazing. My benedict looked too good to actually eat, which was unfortunate because I was rather hungry. The flavor combinations from the egg, the hollandaise sauce, the cream cheese, and the smoked salmon was flawless. If I could eat this everyday, I totally would. My cousin's quiche was pretty amazing as well, having notes of ham, spinach, and other greens baked inside with a perfect texture.

Cassis is a great place to stop by in downtown St. Pete and hopefully next time I'm in down I'll have the pleasure of coming by again.",1
169831,4,"I gave them 4 stars because the food was great on a late Saturday night when every other restaurant had a crazy wait. This restaurant is located in a awkward spot and the entrance is difficult to locate in the dark. My GPS was going crazy. 

My nephews ordered the 1lb Heaven on Earth burgers and OMG they were HUGE!!!  It was enough to feed a family of four. They got through most of the Burger before they surrendered!!! They both were delighted on how juicy and how much flavor a burger of that size had. 

I ordered the the All American Burger and it was a good burger that definitely hit the spot after a football game.",1

4389047,3,"I like this place, but it was personally too far for me. The guys at the shop were very kind. The park, which is two warehouses was a bit intimidating at first. There's a lot of ""punk"" culture in there. Every one was very polite and kept to themselves though. This is not a good park for beginner skaters. I mean, depends on the personality of the child. It is very much a ""free for all"" and no rules seem to be enforced. I was impressed that everyone seemed to follow a code of sorts. My children managed to make some friends at the end of it. Just remember to get past the initial intimidation of the pro's who's grinding and flying makes sounds that resonate in the warehouse.

It has been quite a while since I have visited a British eatery so I decided to take a chance on it. Reason being, I've not found one that was near comparable to the last one I frequented some 25 years back and there is just not that many around. With all that said, I must say that I have found another one just like the other one. My son said the meat pie that he ordered was to die for, and so was the mild and tasty fish and chips that I had. My fish was accented with some of the best tarter sauce on the side and was just awesomeous. The chips were cooked to perfection and the malt vinegar very flavorful, along with the salad greens that were fresh and crispy. What a class act. Very reasonably priced and with generous portions. I and my son highly recommend it. I can't wait to go back and try their bangers and mash. Great hard cider. Peter being from South London, was on the grill and let me tell you, the man can cook. I highly recommend this quaint eatery/pub to all. If you've never ate at a British eatery, you are in for a treat and if you have before, try out this new place, you'll be hooked.

1982241,5,"I signed up for a ten-class pass after taking a virtual Yelp class with The Dailey Method. After being home for months in quarantine, I'd been telling myself that I'd cut costs by doing workouts on my own. However, after just one class with The Dailey Method, I realized that I needed more of this. There is something about the accountability of a live, virtual event. The fact that you have to physically sign up and pay for the class makes you work out SO MUCH harder than you would on your own. Having my camera on while working out with other people at the same time makes for such a wonderful community and is the accountability needed to not take shortcuts. It really helps me get the most possible out of each workout. 

I've taken classes from Ellen and Michael and love them both so much. Ellen is incredibly encouraging, positive and fun, and Michael is so funny and encouraging, that I look forward taking classes from either of them (and I believe they have a few more people on their team). Both teachers also push you to do your best and not waste your workout, yet always bring up modifications for those who need them and want to customize the workout to their body.

I ordered the ""Orleans"" cocktail with gin and it was sweet and strong. At a steep $10 I would have splurged for another because that's how good it was. My waiter, Dicky, was also fantastic; I asked him his opinion on all my ordering and he was honest and attentive. For these two reasons I would return. 

The food however, could use some work. I ordered the corn and shrimp bisque as an appetizer. Very savory broth with a good corn crunch. However, the shrimp basically melted in your mouth because of how over cooked they were. After eating one, my fave immediately puckered up and I avoided them. Dipping the complimentary bread in the broth was a tasty bite, but the shrimp - UGH! 

For my dinner, I ordered the grand isle salad which was basically a buffet of toppings. The remoulade should not be paired with this salad. It may be good with a fish dish but definitely didn't go well with lettuce. I ordered a side of ranch (homemade I think??) and my salad got much better. The shrimp are boiled in a Cajun seasoning and have a hot - not too hot - flavor that's appealing. The biggest downfall of this dish is the crab shell pieces in the lump crab topping. Almost every bite I took had a piece of cartilage in it and for me, that's completely unacceptable. 

With Bourbon Street having such a wide variety of bars and restaurants, this establishment will need to step up.",1
3656640,4,"It's only fair if you call a place out and they make improvements that you update your review. Danielle the General Mgr reached out to me directly right after my original review and I shared my thoughts.

Since February I think the atmosphere has definitely improved as well as the service.  The new items on the Specials Food menu have become must haves and I can only hope the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich makes its permanent place on the full menu.  

Early this year I never would have imagined that I would be looking for their annual Xmas gift card promotion however the team in Blue Bell have worked hard to bring me back to the fold.  I hope they offer the Gift Cards with the extra savings again - Will definitely take advantage.

While I think the cost for basic draft beer is still too high compared to other area places I frequent, you will find me and friends at our familiar spot at the bar!",1
5245678,3,"A group of 4 of us came on a Saturday evening without reservations; BAD idea! We got there at 8pm, and we were not seated until 10:40pm. They had a bar, but that was considered seating as well, so you couldn't just grab a seat there. We decided to wait because my friend really wanted to try this place. Any-who, once seated our waiter came right away with water and menus. He answered any questions we had. Orders were placed rather quickly since we were starving. We were seated by the kitchen with big windows, and a nice view of the chefs. Pizzas came out about 20 minutes later. Both were nice, but honestly nothing to write home or shoulder shimmy about, especially when the bill came to $78 for TWO pies. 

Being that the wait was so long, reservations are pretty much impossible, and the price tag for ok pizza, I wouldn't return.",1

1171867,4,"They have a great variety of food choices and a friendly staff. You can sit at the bar, a table, a booth or outside. Volleyball was playing on the TV. I had the gogi bowl and my husband had the rodeo burger and I got a side of chips. It was yummy. Would love to go again. Wish they were on my side of town.",1
5538113,4,"I've been going to ulele since it opened.  It has expanded to a fun day time hang out. There is a beautiful lawn where you can hang with your friends and family including fur babies.  There is an outside bar for your convenience.  It is very close the end of the Tampa river walk making it very convenient to stop by during a bike ride as well. 
There is indoor and outdoor seating available.  There is an outdoor area in the back called the beer garden that can be rented out for parties as well.   If the weather is right, it's a nice little venue.  They take reservations and have plenty of great food and drink options.  The service is usually great as well. 

Appetizer wise: I really enjoy the fried okra and jalapeño corn muffins.  

If you can't go wrong coming here for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  The food is excellent and the ambiance is great.  Can't go wrong!  If you haven't already ... definitely check this place out - anytime of day!",1

5274697,5,"I've always been a fan of Busch Gardens and am very thankful that Tampa has a theme park along with a water park as well. We used to have an annual pass but didn't use it as often as we should have so we only go during Howl-O-Scream or a random day. It's an awesome place for a theme park and is very big in comparison to other parks. For days where we don't feel like dealing with Universal/Disney World traffic or lines, we go to Busch Gardens for our alternative and I must say that I've never been disappointed with Busch Gardens. They also have animal safaris and a lot of things to do there. It's always a grand time every time. If you are going during busy peak days and hours such as spring break, summer, Howl O Scream, I would highly recommend the fast pass because if not, you will not be having any fun waiting in those extreme lines.",1
17642,5,"It's all about the cannoli! Don't try to share it- it won't work. You need to order your own. I'd love to try some of their other baked goods but I can't get past that freshly made, perfectly crunchy shell with the amazing not-to-sweet, creamy chocolatey chip filling. It's worth the hassle of trying to find parking and walking sideways to cut through the Reading Terminal crowds.",1
1093953,5,"Tried sour cherry cheesecake. It comes with traditional biscuits base which I adore, the cheesecake part is quite delightful and fluffy, maybe fluffy is not an appropriate word to describe, I mean it's not heavy or dense! Wish the sugar amount can be cut a bit for the cake, especially for the cherry jam, more sour components can definitely bring the contrast out and elevate the general tasting experience.",1
1085570,4,"We had our stop at park city during our super city tour with gray line. We stopped there for 20 minutes, the park is beautiful but when I compare it to Central Park, I think it doesn't meet my expectations since it is actually larger than Central Park.",1

1900388,5,"Today being the 50th observance of Earth Day - the 1st in my high school years when I 'woke' for how personal behavior about consumption can contribute to good outcomes or bad ones - it seems appropriate to update my review for Roots.  Not just because being a regular shopper and fan since it opened in Fall 2019 has made me even more mindful of how everything is connected to everything else and allowed me to find new ways to improve my already 'waste not' orientation.  Also because of the good options Roots has provided for my husband and me during the weeks of covid19 concerns when we have continued to be able to safely shop for fresh produce and local eggs and grocery items - like flour, candied ginger, honey, yeast, nuts, organic jam - as well as convenient and delicious take away eats.

SAFE & ""ahhh...some"" SHOPPING:  Crowd sizes are small and shoppers coming inside for the first time are reminded of social distancing, all shoppers are provided with disposable gloves at the door and that the entire store always smells good and feels sparkling bright and welcoming with something fun to listen to as tunes on the sound system is an ""ahhhh....some"" thing to experience any time but in particular in these covid19 times as shoppers when we go in weekly.  

GOOD PRODUCE:  Some of the produce bought at Roots over the seasons has been among the best we purchased anywhere - things like Meyer or Pink Stripe lemons and all kinds of citrus delivered to the store this winter by a couple who went to Arizona weekly to pick it up, graffiti eggplant, beautiful fat heads of romaine lettuce that stay fresh for salads over a week at home, purple tipped asparagus when the season started, local potatoes of all kinds including Huckleberry - Gold ones which seem new this season in specialty stores, big bunches of fresh celery and great apples to use for Waldorf salads, delicious regular Brussels sprouts as well as pretty bronzey 'ruffled' ones...each trip in is a chance to explore something new and be creative cooking at home.  The owner, is almost always in the store and can answer questions about produce for what the source is and how to use it if you're uncertain and everyone who works there is so friendly in the way of ""we're glad you came"".

DELICIOUS DELI: We also appreciate the take out from their in store kitchen deli for nights when we don't want to cook (as much as we loooove to cook there are always those nights these days) when we can enjoy prepared things to eat at home.  When I recommend Roots deli to people who have never been there and they ask me what the food is like I say ""Mother Earth cooking"" so all the more perfect timing to list the 'for examples' here on Earth day:   *housemade soups that are often vegan or vegetarian like a great wild mushroom, *eggplant parmesan (a dish I love and this is one of the best),*vegan shepherd's pie, *lentil loaf, *yellow eyed bean and local pasture raised pork in cassoulet style, *multiple kinds of delicious potato salads, *veggie salads like some made with kale or Brussels sprouts or fresh corn, *pasture raised chicken enchilada casserole,*sweet potato enchiladas *Buddha bowls made vegan and omnivore styles...the list goes on.  And in their deli they also have cheeses and deli meats they can slice for you to buy or make a sandwich for you.

During the covid19 times of take out only (in normal times we have enjoyed eating in), some of these dishes came prepacked for 4 or 6 servings in oven friendly containers and we used those to freeze and reheat when needed with delicious and healthy eating outcomes...in just about exactly the amount of time it took us to sip a glass of wine, dinner was ready. 

COMMUNITY:  There has always been a sense of community gathering place about Roots when we were dining in.  And they have a nice patio out back that we imagine would make one feel the same way.  When covid19 closures are relaxed for eateries, we look forward to Roots being one of the few places we'll go back to sooner rather than later because we know they will manage the seating and service in the same responsible way they do everything.

We're glad Roots is here.  The 50th Anniversary of Earth Day seemed a good day to recommend it to others again.",1
338833,5,"All of nature harmoniously sings out.  Choruses of angelic voices ring loud.  The sun glows bright, and all is beautiful. These are just some of the things that happen whenever we have Amato Brothers.  We are willingly trying almost everything on their huge menu without disappointment yet. We recently tried their chicken Caesar salads and once again - Magnificently Impressed!  When a deli/caterer prepares food with such precision and skill, making sure every bite is filled with passion and care, it no longer is just a deli.  It becomes legendary. This Is what Amato Brothers has become.  By far the best hoagies in the area and well worth it if you have to make a drive.  Don't just read this and continue patronizing your local boring shop because ""they're convenient"". Get in your car and come to this amazing establishment. You won't regret it.

2575807,5,"I am rating the coffee here as the best I can find in the city.  You just know from the first, creamy taste that this place is for serious about what they do (and also the long, kind of expert/snobby sort of conversation I had with the barista, who had very artful taste in his clothing and facial hair choices).  

I have been trying coffee shops all over Philly, and recording prices for the same thing I always get: the soy latte.  Over here they brew one village coffee, which unlike other brands, does not taste quite as bitter.  They do a wonderful job with the foam art on the top, and the guy who usually gives me my lattes from behind the counter is always extremely friendly, and does not disdain me for being financially dressed and mainstream-looking, as are most of the people who go in there.  This is probably because they have developed a very strong following amongst their regulars, who tend to be yuppy office-people who are older than me.  

The downside:  my soy latte was $4.11.  Yup.  That's right.    But totally worth it from Nook.",1
4367708,5,"Was off work today and tried this place since it's only a couple blocks from our house. I ordered the Mediterranean tacos with falafel, unsure what to expect. Got
it to go, headed home, and just finished taco #2 of 3. Awesome! The falafels had a nice crust and were soft and creamy inside, really good slightly sweet chopped tomatoes, a little humus, and just a hint of lemon pulled it all together. Super tasty - I will be back :)",1

The Server was educated on selection of wines with pairing of food.  You get a sense of the passion one has for food and drink by the way they present it and speak about it. That will always leave a positive mark for me. 

The ambience was relaxing and warm.  2 fire pits blazing in the patio, a warm subtle breeze as the evening set (while I was there). A great place for a good conversation with friends or that someone special.  I really did enjoy this restaurant.  I will be back for more.",1

6188378,4,"I'm not one to eat at a convenience store. Growing up with my family owning groceries stores and eating there have me never wanting to purchase any food that is not from a restaurant. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong eating at a convenient store but when you at a young age working and eating there for so long, you tend to get sick of it. I was at the Zoo and didn't want anything they offered so while letting the kids eat, I used Yelp to find  something close by. This place really got some good reviews and I'm a sucker for Korean food so I decided to take a 5 min drive away and check it out. This place is not your typical convenience store. They also sell milk, drinks, wines and things a typical corner store would sell.  There is also an  open kitchen. They serve hot plates , poboys , wraps, sliders, chicken wings, Korean and Vietnamese. They only serve Pho on Saturday. I order some fried rice which I don't care for because it doesn't taste like fried rice, more like jambalaya or something else. I ordered the seafood platter but was inform   they don't have oysters so I substitute the oyster for extra fish. I was glad I got extra fish. It was fried and seasoned perfectly. The shrimp was ok. I also ordered the Korean pork wrap which is my favorite. It was a fairly good amount for the price I paid and so yummy. The jalapeno and the sauce that came with the wrap was delish! I also got the Korean BBQ Pork Poboy, a Vietnamese Banh Mi style. It was also delicious but I'm not really a big fan of Poboy so I rather prefer the wrap. So glad I took a chance and try them out.",1

We have been going to Outback Steakhouse on Ina for many many years at this moment in time I wouldn't recommend going for a great steak. I would say happy hour is fun and if you drink wine you can get a discount. I also like the coconut shrimp but now they are over cooking the coconut crust, because they put them into the oil shrimp too cold. That's probably health department rules.

Mike and Carolyn were the best and helped us create a great food experience from cocktail hour, all the way through dessert. Their organization and attention to detail of every morsel of food and plate that went out was top notch. Coming from a catering background, they also had great recommendations that were cost effective and affordable. 

One week from the wedding, they easily allowed a menu change to the most talked about food of the night, the Mini Korean Fried Chicken Tacos w/ pickled vegetables, sesame and scallion serving straight out of the food truck! We'd also heard Mike was up the night before cutting up cherry tomato slices for the mini burgers. They served a red wine braised short rib that just melted. 

Our guests loved their food and the professional service; food came out warm, the entire staff was accommodating to everyone. The food exceeded our expectations and we still talk about it all the time.

Mike and Carolyn are great at what they do. They serve the best food at a high standard. If you're looking for a caterer,  getting married, and/or want to create a great affordable food experience, call Taco Mondo/StreetFoodPhilly (or any food truck you love) and you'll be better off w/ high quality food as opposed to that generic wedding buffet-esque meat/potatoes/greens plate .",1

Unfortunately I've changed one too many diapers since we went so I can't recall exactly what we had.  I know we had the cheese plate and some sort of salad.  I remember really enjoying both of those, but what I remember the most about the night was the Old Fashioned  cocktail in a bottle.

I'm afraid that my colleagues and I lacked imagination when it came to ordering.  We each had the Turkey Wrap, I went out on a limb and ordered swiss cheese on mine once I discovered they had the technology to put cheese on my sandwich:)

So I can't be too harsh on the place what we got was good pub fare, the service was very good and the pricing fair.

6700764,4,"Hobby Lobby reminds me of Michael's but with a whole lot of home furnishings and furniture.  Parking lot is big with plenty of spaces even on busy days. There are two entrances that are parallel to each other for easy of access.  Walking in, the registers are front and center with walkways to the right to get into the main area of the store.  Layout is fairly simple and intuitive with items like paint, arts and crafts, and similar items in the same area. There were two large areas that were dedicated to Halloween and Christmas items.  Was weird to see all the Christmas items, but I guess it's becoming a year round business.  The day we were there, it was pretty busy so checkout lines were a bit long, hence the deduction of 1 star.  It was a bit chaotic and people were getting impatient.  Pricing is decent and comparable to other stores and online storefronts.  Would I be back? Most likely, but they are 30 minutes from me so I would need to organize a shopping excursion to the Outlet mall or Costco nearby.",1

5867756,5,"HANDS DOWN THE BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD. 

I ordered take out the first time I came here; I came here at 11:30, 30 minutes after it had opened, and there were already 50 people in line. I was in shock. From that moment, I knew it was going to be a good meal. 

The second time I came, there were only 5 people in front of us at 7 pm. The restaurant was pretty empty at this time. 

Both times, I shared a full slab of ribs with other people. The ribs here are so GOOD! The meat just falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. It's so tender and soft, and it was slightly fatty in some parts, which gave it even more flavor. When it's served, it doesn't have any sauce on it; there's just dry rub. There's multiple bottles of sauces on the table that you can add to your ribs. I actually liked it the most without any of the sauces. It's a decent price, and sharing it with 1 or 2 other people is a pretty good deal. It also comes with 2 sides. I've tried the sweet potato fries and potato salad. My fries were a bit soggy, which was disappointing, but the potato salad was great! It was refreshing after a few bites of the ribs. 

I've already been here twice in the past 6 weeks and will definitely be back again!",1
4274083,3,"This review is based off of their brunch. 

Pros: $8 bottomless mimosas, very nice airy but cozy atmosphere, service was great.

Biscuit and gravy was very good. Veggie omelet with goat cheese was simple and fresh tasting. The only thing I thought was weird that the entrees that came with a waffle was served with a half a waffle...why not do the whole waffle? Maybe they found a lot of people couldn't finish it, but it looked a little skimpy. I don't know if I would return for brunch but I would be interested in trying their dinner menu.",1

The staff, including the sales manger, were friendly and actually quite fun to speak with. If you are looking for a car I would highly recommend these folks.",1

3067593,4,"I ate there with my mother. I order the bone-in New York strip and she ordered the Lamb Osso Buco. We started out with the Caprese salad and the Wagyu beef Carpaccio.

The service was great; Tiffany was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. We didn't order any wine though.

The decor was very upscale and metropolitan.

About the dinner:

The Carpaccio was very good and came the traditional accompaniments: no complaints there. The Caprese salad needed a bit more. The homemade mozzarella cheese was wonderful and so were the tomatoes. It came with a balsamic fig reduction, but it was only a smear on the plate. I would ask for some on the side next time with  some olive oil as well. It would have been nice with a fine artisan salt sprinkled on top.

The lamb was fall-off-the-bone tender and flavorful and the faro pilaf was a nice change of pace from your run-of-the-mill side starches.

My NY strip was tender and cooked to perfection.

Overall it was a great night out and I'd go back. Next time, I'll try the seafood.",1
523125,4,"A new fun place in town! Long line all the way to the door, but it took only about 30 min to get to the cashier & have our order in hand. Lots of options for flavor combos & toppings or build your own custom. 

The process of making the icecream rolls is really cool to watch & encouraged. 

The place is new so I expected the crowd & the wait was tolerable! The dessert was totally different & tasty. 

The reasons why I didn't give them a 5th star:

It's HOT in there...yes it was crowded but it was really hot & stuffy inside.

Very little seating- we sat outside on the curb to eat our treat.

I will be back though, more flavors to try & I'll make sure to pick an odd time in hopes it's not as packed.",1

My friend had a plate of four large blue crabs, which he raved about.  I had linguini with lump crab meat in a spicy red sauce that contained spinach, tomatoes and roasted red peppers - excellently flavored.  My friend's blue crab dish came with a potato choice.  He opted for the garlic potatoes.  They were absolutely excellent.  His entre also included a dish of ice cream for dessert.  I had a baklava cheesecake - also good.  Will definitely be back.  Also had courteous, competent, friendly service from Katelyn.",1
6468278,4,"According to my sister, this is the best Pizza you'll find in Tucson.  
Both times I have visited we've come here and had really good pizza.  Unfortunately this time, school was in session and I guess this is where high school kids like to hang out, which was pretty annoying.  I'm glad I knew I wasn't cool when I was in high school.  These kids think they're in charge of everything because their graduating this year, someone even tried to steal sunglasses when another patron was picking up his order.  The kid got caught and got yelled at by a very scary man.  Back to the food though, Pizza is delicious, better than SOME of my favorites from home, then they have these garlic bread bites which are great too.  They serve Yoo-hoo!  I always tell my sister that her home is the Yoo Hoo capitol of the world because you can find it everywhere in Tucson.  In the bay area, I have to travel to obscure gas stations or wal-marts to find my favorite chocolate drink.",1

The front desk said ""no problem"", it would be there. When we arrived, they were all rented out. The employees in the parking garage offered us a smaller SUV at a reduced rate (which wouldn't have worked), but then found a really nice upgraded, even larger SUV (than our original reservation) and offered it to us at the original rate. We were very pleased. Spouses are included drivers at no extra cost.",1

So, if you are looking for a delicious, budget friendly place to take a date, this is your spot. For $10 a person you can get a basic hot dog (unlimited toppings) and split some fries. Or splurge and get some fancy dog or fancy fries. Either way, you will be guaranteed to wow your date without draining your wallet.

The drinks are delicious and so is the good. I recommend the chef's pick for two people. You get to pick one from each category on the menu. The French onion soup was a little short on the broth, but everything else was amazing. The salads are perfectly seasoned and not too much dressing. The Brussel sprouts are perfectly crispy. Overall great experience.",1

The artichoke was not very good in my opinion but it was creative. For my entree I had the ravioli. This was the best ravioli I have ever ordered. The sauce was amazing. The ravioli was thin and stuffed with delicious cheese. For dessert my cream brûlée was cooked perfectly. Crunchy and top and cold/think filling. We will definitely dine her again.,1
5566419,3,"Stopped here today for lunch because I was in the area. I haven't been here in quite a while. The place is still the same though. I always go with the Italian, I love they use full slices of pepperoni. I'm not a huge fan of their rolls, they are always flakey and the meat slides off. It is a messy hoagie but that's not always a bad thing. They do not put pickles or peppers on the sand which but they charge you .25 cents for sides. Overall it's a decent sandwich packed full of meat and fresh sliced. They had a place in wildwood a few years back but that has been close for some time. I also heard the place just recently sold, let's hope it stays the same. 3 stars",1
3346631,5,"This place is such a VIBE!! We stumbled along here because we wanted some live music and this was the place. It is super dark but it adds to the experience. Our server Sasha was amazingggggg!! She was so sweet and nice with her recommendations I could not love her more! I thought it was thoughtful when my friend was ordering she asked if she thought it would be enough because the portions were small and that's such a nice gesture so someone is not surprised by the size when their plate came out.

The drinks were so good. I tried the spicy marg that was on the menu and it wasn't that spicy but I'm also a spice fanatic, but it was still good! We also got a few chocolate martinis and those were to DIE FOR!! MUST TRY!

I got the shrimp and crab linguine and it was so good! Everyone in our party was super happy with their food! And it all came out in a timely manner and all at the same time.",1

1331177,4,"As far as sculpture gardens, this is one of my favorite in the U.S. I've walked through it several times and it seems like they're continually adding pieces. The pieces are interesting and varied, and best of all, so large that you can walk all around, under, and sometimes on them.

Even if you don't like modern sculptures, the park itself is very beautiful and nice for jogging or walking with a friend or your kids. The exhibits inside the main building have also been very good. Take the time to walk around the entire park, and through all its wooded trails, it's larger than appears from the parking lots.

The only suggestion I'd make is to get better security. There are a lot of clowns that hang of the pieces or stupid parents who let their kids crawl on more fragile pieces, even though signs forbid it.",1

Cons: literally the worst breakfast dish I have ever ordered in my adult lifetime. I got the Cajun hash browns. The whole plate seemed like it sat outside for two hours before being served to us.

5463286,4,"My wife and I stopped in at this Culver's location on a Sunday afternoon for a bit of the ol' custard and were really surprised at the level of customer service that we received. As we walked in the door, one of the employees was walking out, and as he did he held the door open for us and greeted us with a nice smile. We took a minute or two looking at the menu (there was no one in front of us) and the same employee walked behind the register to take our order.

We both ordered a mini custard, got a number, and went to our seat. That same employee (even though there were others working in the area) put our order together and personally brought it to our table. We know that it's not something that he had to do, but it was just nice to see a smiling, friendly face throughout the entire experience.

The custard itself was fantastic, and we relished every minute of it (we were rewarding ourselves after a two-mile hike). I've been to this location one other time before, and we had a positive experience that time as well, even though the restaurant was much more crowded than it was our most recent visit. We live close to this location so we'll be back for sure!",1

Some big name furniture stores have all broken model furniture on the floor, eg broken drawers. Everything I saw at Facera's was very good quality and I was also very impressed with the prices.

I purchased a dining room table and chairs, a complete bedroom set, and a secretary desk. While it took about 5 weeks for some of the pieces to come in, I didn't mind as my new home was not yet ready to be moved into.

When the furniture came it looked as great as in the showroom. At the end of the day, I still had money left in my budget, which made me very happy.

6457900,3,"It seemed like I had just searched for smoothies on Yelp and wasn't able to find one with its hours posted in the area that might be open at 7:30 on a Saturday. I don't know how Robeks didn't show up, but I was headed to a nearby creamery when I noticed their lights on and thought it would be a great time to try it, as I really wanted a smoothie more than ice cream.

My first impression of the store was that it smelled like a mix between pulverized fruit and cleaning fluids. But I was taking my smoothie to-go, so this did little to deter me.

The menu is short and simple, but virtually everything contains banana, which I'm allergic to. This is a common problem at smoothie shops. I chose the Passionfruit Cove, rather than ask about substitutions in other smoothies.

The girl at the counter was friendly and happy to explain the rewards program, and explain a little bit about the smoothies and boosts, since it was my first time. It wasn't busy, so my smoothie came up quickly, and I left.

The smoothie itself wasn't bad. I think it was sweeter than I expected, and a little icier. I would put it in the same category as Xoom Juice or Jamba Juice, where the question of ""which is best"" is left to personal preference. For me, it's not quite as good as those two. But I do think they're open later, and that turned out to be a strong benefit on Saturday night.",1

The spinach salad with goat cheese was perfect.  The tapenada on homemade fresh bread was so delicious that I almost didn't have room for the pasta.  The pasta and vegetarian red sauce was amazing.

3813221,4,"I've never met a person from the NE that doesn't rave about this place including my parents. It's good. Always consistent. Is it the best? Worth going out of the way for?No, but good for the area. 

I don't particularly love their chips and salsa especially compared to other places but at least they're complimentary. I can't stand when you have to pay for them. Now don't get me wrong, I'll still happily down way more than I should of these. People flip for their table side guac. Nice touch especially in a not so fancy place like this. Bonus points for that. 

Decent margaritas that get the job done. 

My Mom religiously for years has ordered the Camarone Vallarta which is basically a salad smothered  in cheese with huge shrimp. She always counts them. Sometimes up to 13 decent sized shrimp. 

They have a lot of clearly marked vegetarian options. A lot of carb crap like cheese quesadillas, rice and beans etc. Combo meals for cheap though. I've had the fajitas which are great and today I was torn between the avocado salad for about $6 and the the fajita salad for $12 which comes with the option to add meat if you wish. I compromised and got the fajita salad with a side of avocado to put on top. You pick the dressing. I opted for oil vinaigrette. The salad was good. Hot veggies over iceberg, tomatoes slices and cucumbers tossed very lightly in the dressing. I would absolutely order this again. And it will probably be my new healthy go to when I'm in a place where there aren't many healthy options. 

Kid meals are cheap and huge. 

Service was fast. The waitress today was awesome. You can tell everyone here works hard for their money. Same host perhaps the owner greets you every time which is nice. 

I've been lucky and never really had to wait that long on a weekend night, but they do NOT take reservations. You can grab a drink at the bar while you wait however. 

It's not my first choice, but a nice option for the area. Actually, I think the only Mexican option around there which may add to its popularity.",1

We were continuously shown rings way beyond our price range and kept getting pressured into opening a credit account.

Her first question to me was, ""Do you have any pictures save on your phone or pinned on pinterest of styles you like?"" I thought it was very cool that she immediately wanted to see what kinds of things I liked instead of just pulling random rings out of the case.

glad to have them in the neighborhood.",1
3255385,5,"I really love the ambiance Tito and Pep create in their restaurant space! It's so retro and vintage with green glass lights, and the accents of blue and orange throughout the dining area. My boyfriend and I went for brunch this past Sunday and I was SO worried we'd have to wait a while. We arrived right when they opened at 11 and were seated very quickly. The restaurant didn't start really getting full until around 11:45-12ish. I ordered a mimosa and my boyfriend, at the recommendation of our waitress, ordered the cactus cooler both were amazing. We ordered the warm pastries to start, it was a lot of bread for 2 people, but I'd imagine it would be a godsend if you're hungover. My boyfriend ordered the EL ""SIESTA DESPUES"" (the nap later) and it was huge! A little too spicy for me, but he loved it! I ordered the T&P omelette which has roasted green chile, it was amazing, slightly spicy, slightly sweet and the side salad's acidity really brought the dish together. You can tell they take great pride in their food. I'll be back soon for dinner! It's a great date spot as well!",1
5978837,4,"Went in here on a Groupon deal just to try it and was pleasantly surprised!  The food was fresh and flavorful.  The staff could have been a little friendlier but the place was understaffed so I'm not dinging it too much for that.  As for the decor, it could definitely use a good spruce up as well.  The pitcher of sangria given as part of the deal was a very nice touch! Try it, you'd like.",1
105586,3,"I used to love going to this place, however it has recently been degraded to a low quality sushi buffet. Their sushi selection is quite limited and doesn't offer any of the higher quality special rolls such as Dragon or Spider. The restaurant does offer shabu shabu and some hot soups. The highlight would be their nigirizushi and sashimi. Although not the freshest, these two items make the meal tolerable. They also got rid of their froyo machine and replaced it with ice cream.",1

6874267,4,"What's not to love about Biscuits? 

Biscuit Love comes with a wait, unless you get there at opening. Honestly though, 7am is too early for biscuits for me, so I was happy to wait when I finally woke up. The line moves quick as well, so overall, it didn't take too long before I sat down with my number. 

I ordered the East Nasty, which they advertise as a dish that was named the best sandwich in America. I'm not sure what publication named it this, but it is a pretty solid biscuit! The chicken thigh is very generous, and it almost felt strange to eat that much meat for breakfast; The sausage gravy definitely helped to keep the meal from being too dry overall. 

Biscuit Love is a Nashville institution, so I had to visit before I left the city. I'm glad I made the trek, as it certainly is a satisfying meal to start the day!",1

I attribute this to her being too busy and or the restaurant understaffed. In addition, this place was way to pricey for the food. $9 for a tap corona for example is a Niro bee the top. Also $9 for a bean and cheese burrito for our 5 year old son!  You've gotta be kidding, right?  Sadly, no.",1

There were six of us and everyone enjoyed their meals. Risotto with chicken, risotto with scallops, burnt ends and salmon. Everything was hot, well prepared and tasty.

3771609,4,"It seems like things have been equalizing at Pho Long for the past few months now. The food has been consistent and good, we even spoke to one of the cooks today who came out and asked how everything was, and we were pleased to report back with two thumbs up. The service has also been more on point lately. It's worth saying again, i've been a fan of Pho Long pretty much since they opened, and i've stuck with this place even when i didn't feel like it was at its best. At its core is a really good restaurant and i'm glad it's coming back around lately. I'll continue dining here and will update accordingly.

Previous reviews below...

-----------------------

Second Review: Hate to have to downgrade my review, but my favorite pho spot has been on the slow and steady decline for a year or so now, really ever since Anne left. Lately, it's been difficult to get our group seated together, which saddens me b/c i've been going w/ the same people for the past 7 years (since their old location next door) and now they expect us to split up amongst different tables. They've stopped accommodating split checks (this hasn't been a personal issue yet) which just seems like a poor choice for a lunch crowd (this is why i stopped going to Momo's). We constantly have to go back to the counter to request waters, napkins, chopsticks, etc., the service is so inattentive and impersonal now ... this update really isn't written with spite, malice or revenge ... it's really sad to me, i have so many memories of awesome lunches with my friends here and it's like they're dismantling everything that was good about the place slowly but surely. The food is still fine, but service makes a place great and i can only hope it makes a comeback here. Also, still no wifi? Come on guys! See my previous review below to see how far my opinion has fallen, bummer.

-----------------------

First Review: I've been going here at least once a week for the last five years, even before they moved from next door in their old location. Pho Long has my favorite bowl of pho in town, great spring rolls, egg rolls and gyoza too. Haven't tried much else of the menu because I like my staples so much I can't seem to deviate from them! 

The staff is also awesome, they know mine and my group's orders (with each having their own peculiarities) by heart, I've had many lengthy and friendly conversations with many of them and it feels like home every time I eat here. Pho Long for life!",1
4224026,5,"Urgh! Educational! No! Just kidding - the National World War II Museum should entertain those with even a little interest in history.

The displays were extraodinary and informational. There were authentic memorabilia, interactive displays, audio clips, and videos. I took interest in everything I saw. The only thing I found odd was that I had to buy my tickets in one buildiing and then walk over to another building. That was confusing. 

I finished the trip with a visit to the gift shop. I ended up buying a tee shirt for my uncle. If you're looking for a specific size, you may have trouble. Everything was picked over. I also played with the smushed penny machine and got a Rosie the Riverter souvenir. But it wasn't actually a flat penny. It was a flat quarter. But well worth it I think.",1

Lauren also set me up with some hair products I really like. I'll definitely be back!,1

5856003,4,"Forget that you have ever heard the words ""Papa Johns"",""Pizza Hut"", and "" Domino's"" . Order a pizza from Roma's and there is no going back. That's because their pizzas are way better and their prices are comparable to those before mentioned chains.  In addition their menu is far more extensive. The options for vegetarians are great. I love their California Veggie Pizza but they also have a normal Vegetarian Feast, a Spinach Pizza, and a Greek Pizza. And that's not mentioning the vegetarian pasta, calzone, and sub options. All of which they deliver.",1
3424519,3,"Aya was a mixed bag for me. Came here with friends for a workday lunch. My chicken kebab over salad (~$12) was excellent -- tender flavorful grilled chicken breast pieces over nice greens accompanied by a chunk of grilled purple onion; portion size was ample.  But the dips on the appetizer platter ($17) were lackluster and disappointing. Fava bean, baba ghanouj and garlic hummus were among the six (?) mini ramekins that were just bland. The stuffed grape leaves were very good, but I also didn't care for the falafel, which had an unusually finely mashed, creamy interior unlike any other falafel I've had, and I wasn't crazy about it.",1
2257704,5,"Ally is the amazeballs! Great service, fun, friendly and courteous. Love the vibe of this place. Greg from Chesters Harley suggested we visit - so we did. First time in years that I sat down and enjoyed a cold refreshing Rolling Rock on a hot day! The BLTA caprese salad is delicious!",1
5076091,4,"I went into their shop for the first time. I honestly had a hard time finding it, but that's because of the construction right outside their door. 

The environment inside was very minimal, but inviting and comfortable. It was very welcoming and everyone in there, including the owners, were very friendly. There was a feeling of peace and happiness within the shop.

The guy behind the counter was very nice, brought me my drink when it was ready, and exceeded expectations.

The pour over, I had the Guatemalan, had great flavor and was a well-roasted bean. I am not a fan of bright fruity coffees, but this one surprised me and I enjoyed two cups of it while I was there. The one thing they did not have was decaf coffee or espresso, but they had a selection of naturally decaf teas which my friend chose.",1
344881,4,"Finally stopped in for dinner. The ambience is nice, and the fish tank is cool, I would go there just to see it (although that's what pulled me in). When I asked the waitress for her recommendation, she said she loves the Sprimp and Grits which I hoped she would say since I was considering that already. But then she said they had recently updated the menu and the only thing they kept was the swordfish because it was so popular--and I had been considering that too. I went with the swordfish and loved it. Cooked perfectly with great seasoning that didnt overpower. It was served over beans and rice. While the fish came out hot, the beans and rice were warm at best. They must have a huge batch already made. So the temperature of that is my only complaint. BTW I arrived around 5:20 on a Wednesday in early December and had no problem getting a table.",1
6083324,5,"Very nice clean camp grounds. The bath houses were very clean and with plenty of hot water.

2917924,4,"I first visited Baida a while back and had a good experience.  I finally made it back, and once again everything was really good.

We walked in for a late dinner around 9:30 on a Thursday.  Luckily the kitchen was still open and our server was friendly.

For an appetizer, we went with the Bastilla ($9), described as a ""sweet and savory chicken pie"".  It was a nice large serving of shredded chicken and a phyllo dough crust, and some plum and apricot for sweetness.  It was different but really tasty, and the presentation was great.  Highly recommended.

For entrees we went for the lamb chops ($23) and the classic chicken tajine ($15).  Both were great...the lamb chops were cooked medium-rare as requested, served on a large bed of delicious flavorful lentils.  The chops could have used a bit more seasoning, but otherwise this dish really impressed me.  The chicken tajine was also great, with warm comforting flavors and a nice amount of tender meat (1 breast, 1 thigh), along with potato and whole olives.  The presentation on both dishes was also very pleasing.  You could tell that time and effort was put into everything we ordered.

We also got a nice stack of grilled flatbread with our meal, which came in handy to scoop up lentils.  We spend about 50 bucks (not including tip) and this satisfied 3 hungry people.

I'll wait until my next visit before awarding 5 stars.  I hope that more people stop in and recognize the fantastic and interesting food they serve here.  There is currently a Groupon available so there has never been a better time to dive into the awesome world of Moroccan cuisine.

I got the Spartacus burger, which has lamb mixed in the patty as well as beef, with feta, tzatziki sauce, tomato and red onion. The burger was messy but delicious! It tasted fresh with lots of flavor. The fries were so good! They reminded me of fair fries with a hint of malt vinegar taste to them. It was a little on the pricey side for a burger,  but the quality was there enough so that I will be going back to try some more of their burgers.",1
2421646,5,I love this place! I love the atmosphere and it has a great selection of flavors. My favorite is the cotton candy malt! It sounds like it wouldn't be good but it is excellent.

5014269,5,"A family favorite for years, it had actually been some time since we'd had dinner here. It was as good as I remember it being and we had such a great time.

We had made a reservation on Open Table, indicating we had a disabled person in our party that would need some assistance. Upon arrival, the som, a waiter and a back-waiter were already standing curbside to help us; amazing!

And that's what makes Mitch's restaurants so fantastic; attentive, thoughtful, knowledgeable service. 

Highlights from the menu were definitely the Wild Sea Bass and the creme brulee. The entree was beautifully presented and the pancetta was such a lovely counterpoint to the red lentil ""risotto"". I make a pretty mean creme brulee myself, so I'm a tough critic of the dessert in restaurants, but this one didn't disappoint. The only criticism we had was that the apples in the tart were too chunky, but that was a very minor complaint.

We'll definitely be back much sooner this time.",1
4944838,5,This was place was delish! Service was very friendly and the cashews and caramel covered apples were amazing.

Located right on south street and right by TLA so its great to hit after a concert or late night of drinking. The guys who work there are pretty hilarious as well. 

Only issue is since they do serve so many people they make their meat in masses and at times you can get a cheesesteak that is not piping hot and the cheese not melted all the way through. Other then that is not to bad.",1

I think century theaters have taken a hit since the galaxy theatre opened up. Nevertheless you will probably find me here on a Tuesday night for $5 tickets.

183961,4,"This bakery is new to Oliver Square area, and already this place is extremely popular. The bread  they bake here is made of spelt and kamut flour, which I never knew about before visiting this bakery. The person who assisted me, explained a lot about the organic ingredients used during the bread making process, and their health benefits. I am not allergic to soy and gluten, but I am always interested in trying additives-free and organic bread. I bought a pampernickel, a baguette and a loaf of rye bread which the gentleman at the counter offered to slice for me. Each was priced at around $5. Seems like a lot but once I got home and tasted what I bought, I realized that the price tag reflects the amazing quality. No wonder Breadland has royal customers! I very likely may become another one.",1

The gourmet white pies in particular stand out thanks to Felicia's in-house garlic sauce and quality toppings. Prices are very reasonable and wait times are relatively short. The only drawback is that their pies are made with a cornmeal crust, resulting in a very messy, albeit tasty eating experience. My personal favorite items include the Felicia Special, Clams and Garlic Bianca, Grecian, and the Four Cheese with Sweet Onion. Four stars - Recommend.",1

529638,5,"How it took me 3 years to go to this little gem is beyond me. Yea, so the neighborhood isn't all that great but it's the perfect place to go on a Saturday or Sunday mid-morning for a little grocery trip.  

First they offer a box which includes a select list of groceries (listed on their website) for 25$ which is more than reasonable. I received oranges, tangelos, shitake mushrooms, beets, turnups, cabbage, herbs and pecans. It was a lot of healthy food for a reasonable price and I felt good about myself because I'm supporting a local farm. 

I agree with Morgan too, this isn't just a place for hippies, tree huggers, hipsters or vegan crazed maniacs, its a place for the masses with a small amount of adventure. I'll definitely be back again soon, real soon.",1
4941826,3,"The first time I came here, we were told there was a 45 minute wait for two of us, despite more than a few empty tables. It was 9pm on a Friday and we were hungry, so we went to a place that had empty tables AND was willing to seat us.

The second time, we arrived in the early evening on a weeknight - my Groupon was expiring that day or the next so it needed to be used. We were seated immediately inside, where we could now stare at 100 pictures of people eating sloppy burgers. It was weird, but while we waited for service, which was as others have said a bit on the slow side, we entertained ourselves by making fun of them.

I ordered the white bean burger and Cookie Monster shake. The server went out of her way to remind me that the chips are not vegetarian, even though it says so on the menu. Nice touch for sure, and I'm not a vegetarian so non-vegetarian chips were OK by me.

The burger was delicious, though it fell apart a little more each time I took a bite, until I gave up and ate my poor ex-burger pile with my fork. The chips that came with a warning label? Pop chips. Yes, as in the bagged chips in your local neighborhood whatever store. I guess they throw them in burger grease to give them ""edge""? I don't know. The shake was amazing.

Boyfriend got a real burger, and I took a bite. I didn't see fireworks, but it was better than most burgers in Philly.

The top floor was the only one we went to after climbing stairs that felt like one to many. There are two bars on the top floor, 1 indoor and 1 outdoor.

The indoor area had some lounge coach seatings and some dope neon signs with some catchy phrases.

The outdoor area was also fairly large alot of lounge seating and bar stools as well as tables. And a nice sized regular bar. We enjoyed some draft beers and the great views of the area.

Cool place, with top 40/hip hop music which was a great change from all the country music everwhere.",1

I've dealt with many people in the past who made me feel pressured or as if I wasted their time because we weren't happy at the end but nope! Not Stephen, seriously when you come in ask for him and I promise you won't be disappointed!",1

I'm from Los Angeles where everyone has their own barber. I came to NOLA on vacation and for a wedding and needed a cut. I figured the Art of Shaving... why not, close to my hotel and I've heard of them. 

I made a same day appointment with Chris. This guy gets DOWN! Hooked me up with one of the cleanest beard lineups I've ever had in my life and I've had a beard since I was 15. 

Chris is a real cool, down to earth guy. We talked the whole time, just a great dude on top of being a phenomenal barber. He has been cutting hair since he was 14 so the man knows what he's doing.

When I walked back into the room, my wife was VERY impressed. She also agreed, one of the best, if not THEE best beard lineup I've ever gotten.

Thank you again Chris! Next time I'm in NOLA, I'm definitely stopping by, you are the man!!!",1
6348683,5,Probably the first tapas restaurant I ever went to.  Bar Ferdinand has a stellar cold and hot plate menu and a couple items I still remember a few years later.

Food 4/5
Service 4/5
Atmosphere 4/5

I read a few reviews on here before finally deciding to give Mix's a shot.  If you didn't know, pies are a great option for a birthday!  One review that caught my eye stated that they needed at least a week's notice for a food order. That no longer seems to be the case. I placed my order on 11/6 and picked it up on 11/7 for a custom chocolate cream pie.

Another review I read said their pie wasn't filled adequately. That definitely was not the case with mine, as seen in the pictures I've attached! In fact, when I first saw my pie, my immediate reaction was ""holy chocolate!"". Seriously, that thing was so full it looked like a chocolate bubble!

The filling itself was the best I've ever had for a chocolate cream pie. It was VERY rich, so if you like chocolate, get it! The whipped cream was decent. It had volume but lacked flavor.  I agree with other peoples' remarks about the crust. The crust itself was tasty, but definitely not the best I've ever had. It was also WAY too flaky. It did not hold together at all while cutting.

Overall, the shop is cute and I definitely had a positive experience. I spent $25 on my pie. I'll likely be back to try a coconut cream pie but other than that, this might be a once a year visit for me.",1

2350518,5,I stumbled upon this coffee shop with a friend one night. There was live music which from my understanding is a once a month thing. The atmosphere made it hard to leave. We didn't have much to do but weren't planning on more than a quick cup of coffee. We stayed for two hours and only left because they closed! I'd definitely recommend this unique little place if you want to get away from the usual Starbucks and try some quality coffee.,1

6105575,5,"I did a thing and tried Myofascial Cupping.

This review is long : I didn't take the procedure lightly. I read mixed reviews and researched cupping for years prior to this visit. In the end I decided, experiencing it for myself would be the only way to know. SO HERE IT IS FOLKS, twenty years later !! (Ha!)



It was my first time Cupping. I did not know what to expect. Luckily, a little research led me to Grace, who took amazing care of me.

I waited two weeks to complete my review to share an accurate before & after of my experience. 

Reception was lovely. I set up Insurance direct billing and filled up medical history & massage expectations / preferences (10 / 15 minutes) once completed, your on file.

Rooms/bathroom : Clean, spa like, relaxing. I felt like I would be in good hands, great energy. 

Grace, my therapist greeted me and showed me to our room. Prep was that of a basic massage, 
de-robe to your comfort level. Grace, re enters once you are cozied under the warm blanket.

Grace, noticed my skin was cold (not good for loosening fascia / muscles) she got to work using a combination of hot stones and hands to get my blood circulating. When she was satisfied my muscles we warm, she administered a combination of massage and then applied the cups. 

The cups were placed to sit for twenty minutes, while I relaxed. Grace, ensured I was comfortable, checking in as she applied each cup. I felt no discomfort - it is a 'unique' experience to feel your skin suctioned !! Communicate any discomfort so your therapist can adjust or release the pressure as needed.  


Twenty minutes later, Grace returned and removed the cups. She then worked with one cup, attached to a long tube & machine. This machine creates a vacuum allowing gentle suction as she moved a single cup across my back & legs. 

My understanding is Myofascial Cupping, lifts our fascia gently separating our layers of fascia and our muscle, tissue. 

It releases tension and loosens tightness. Combined with follow up massage I found the combination to be more effective then previous bi weekly massage alone. 

Holy Bananas !! What a difference ! 

What to expect: 

To feel good !! 

The back of my Right arm was tender for a few days after. Grace, got into the tissue deeply, at my request. 


Redness lasted 5 days.

120 minutes - cupping & massage $110 (Take my money !!)



Great experience ! I'm going back today for a Deep Tissue Massage & can't wait to try their couples/single tai massage room. They're beautiful. 

Go go go !",1

The chef is so dang talented and you will love every bite.",1
1436148,4,"Who would know that Lulu's serves a yummy Greek salad including red potato salad? Saturday evening at 6 four of us decided it was dinner time. The first place we popped in had a 25 minute wait time which surely would have been longer. I called Lulu's and asked about the wait time. It wasn't so bad. However, when we walked in a 4-top had just opened. The restaurant was jumping including a birthday party next to us with about 12 folks. The server Mariah promptly greeted us with a smile and a great personality. My guy and I split the IRB burger, fries and hush puppies. Our friends had the shrimp dinner with veggies and poppy seed slaw, as well as soup and a grouper sandwich. Mariah and the kitchen had everything right on a busy Saturday evening. Salad and soup came out. And as we completed our first course, our entrees came out prepared perfectly. Mariah offered the key lime pie (who had room?).  Our checks appeared and Mariah said she hoped to see us again soon (she will).

I've been here numerous times and enjoyed good meals but never on a Saturday at dinner time with the snow birds in town. Last night was a real pleasure and our Pittsburgh friend had a great experience. Free ample parking is a real perk too. 

Once again, kudos to Mariah! You rock.",1

The shoe section is a nice size. I have seen bigger, but the shoe selection was nice. The clearance section was on the back back wall.

I looked at the clearance section in the woman's clothes! There were amount left, and no complaints of the prices.

These people know folks will still come in for the original muffaletta, so I think they have scaled back on quality. They have these pre-made and stacked up  so they can just toss it on the counter when you order. The bread on ours was a bit stale and there was more bread than fillings. The olive salad was tasty, and the quality of the meats and cheese was good, but by the end of it all I could taste was the salt of the olives.

Our kids love to get out to Eckert's to get pumpkins and apples in the fall. They discovered just today that strawberries are pretty awesome from Eckert's too!

So, why didn't they get 5 stars? The wait to pay for our stuff is always long. During peak season, I wonder why they don't have more people working so that the lines aren't so long?",1
6279612,3,"I really wanted to love this place. First, because I thought the previous tenant (Warehouse Grille) had pretty damn good burgers. Second, because the outdoor space is awesome. I read the reviews and still decided to go ahead and see. 

First, the plating of the Garlic Chicken Parmesan Bites was straight-up tragic. They just throw a bit of stringy parmesan cheese on top of the chicken bites. It literally looked like they'd added spaghetti on top. They tasted fine, but it just did not make much sense. They clearly waited too long to add the cheese on top - had it been melted, we'd have appreciated that more. Still, being served on a nondescript black plate just made it feel cheap.

Our server recommended the Acapulco Chicken sandwich and the Jerk'd Chicken Enchilada Grande. The sandwich tasted fantastic, but seemed to be chicken slices, whereas a chicken breast would've maybe felt more appropriate. The ""enchilada"" is a damn burrito, which if I'd known that, I would not have ordered it. It was average as hell.

We did get our pups food from the ""dog menu"" which included one option with ground beef, one with chicken, and one with salmon. Our girls definitely enjoyed those.

They have bottomless mimosas and/or rosé, which is great. We did the bottomless rosé. I also had a coffee and a Bloody Mary. The coffee tasted like instant coffee - it was almost like coffee-flavored water. The Bloody was just eh. 

Finally, service is definitely not a strong point here. All the other reviews make that clear as well. But the thing is, the staff is friendly, and they seem eager to learn. It seems like there are management issues in ensuring that staff is properly trained. I still want to come back, especially because of that outdoor space. I guess next time I'll stick to the bottomless drinks and a burger - can't really go too wrong there, right?",1

2892597,3,"Was on my way to Jim's when I saw a sign that said ""Voted #1 Cheesesteak.""  I'm typically a sucker for such high-class marketing tactics but I vowed not to be this time around.  However, it was Saturday, I was thirsty, I just had a slice of Lorenzo's, and a beer sounded nice.  I walked in.

Sat at the bar and took in a Guinness ($4.55) and a Harp ($5) to accompany my Ben Franklin Deluxe Bacon Cheesesteak, which was the regular Philly concoction with an addition of friend onions, Jameson BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato, creamy coleslaw, a Dill pickle spear, with a side of Idaho fries.  It was good except the bacon was non-existent, no creamy coleslaw, the onions not fried, the pickles possibly Dill but definitely not spear, and I realized that cheesesteaks with anything but cheese and steak is not good.  Who puts freaking tomato and lettuce on their steak?  I just did but I mean, I'm a New Yorker, I can commit a Homer in a city not my own.

The bartender was pleasant however.  I peppered her with a few questions about beers such as, ""What's the difference between a 60-minute IPA and a 90-minute IPA in the Dogfish line?""  One is brewed longer.  I was also informed that a 120-minute and a 150-minute exist with each half-hour bringing stronger flavor and potency.  I also asked about the peculiar way she was serving my Guinness as she was using the backside of a peculiar looking spoon to allow the dark frothy liquid hit my pint the right way.  She informed that any bartender who does not serve a Guinness in this manner is [silently shakes her head].

All in all, the place was comfortable and it wasn't too crazy on this lazy, Saturday afternoon.  I think all the Phillies fans were getting drunk elsewhere on South St. trying to forget the Yanks* kicking their candy asses.

2264776,5,"After living downtown for 3 years while getting my hair cut at a good salon in the suburbs, I decided I needed to find a salon in the city. I checked Yelp, and Rinse was one of the top-reviewed places, so I made an appointment. I was scheduled with Michelle, and I couldn't be happier. Whether I have a morning or afternoon appointment, she runs on time, and I never wait more than a few minutes to sit in her chair (not something you can say about many salons). I am EXTREMELY picky about who touches my hair, as I've had one too many traumatizing horrible haircuts. My hair is extremely thick and moderately curly (Jewish hair, as I describe it), which tends to intimidate some stylists. Michelle had a plan for how to cut my hair so it would look the way I wanted the first time she cut my hair, and always makes sure that she knows exactly what I want done before she starts cutting. The salon itself is a cute, unassuming store-front, and was not intimidating to a usually-broke, non-swanky college student like myself.",1
3684656,3,I love Edleys and usually have terrific food and service. This is the first time I ordered take out  from there and was extremely disappointed.

I was worried after there was a huge cluster during the check-in process at the host stand, but I have to say, the food was really excellent. Now, we did have the garlic shrimp and I thought they were overdone, so I might get the toasted ravioli that the table next to us had (looked great). However, the prime rib was perfect. Perfect doneness, generous size, we got perfectly done potatoes (baked) with them. We also got a seasonal salad with strawberry vinaigrette that I could probably eat for every meal for the rest of time. Even the desserts, which are all made in-house, were really fantastic. It was a great meal, and great food can more than make up for other minor annoyances. Don't waste your time with other prime rib restaurants. This is the place to go.",1

There were two hostesses gossiping that we had to say hello to. They didn't say hi or how we were ,just 'how many'. Our waiter was really awkward. I love that everyone is really unique at Chuy's and has their own style but this guy was really out of it. It took over 10 minutes to get water after ordered, and as he was flirting with an extremely obnoxious group of a bachelorette party seated right next to us (thanks for that, host stand UGH they should've been put in a corner or back of the restaurant like in the tire room or something), he finally brought over a scoop of chips to us, and 5 seconds later, someone else ran our order to the table. He then brought a cup of water without ice over to the table and used that as a pitcher to put in my fiancé's empty cup. Our water glasses sat empty as he laughed it up with the bachelorette party and encouraged them to get wasted and celebrate. We stacked our plates with napkins on top, waiting to leave. We had to flag him down, and after the 3rd attempt, he did finally come take my fiancés card to cash out...however, 12 minutes passed by and I had assumed he decided to go shopping with the credit card. I did time it, as it was getting to be quite comical, and I was about to go find a manager or at least the waiter to get the card back so we could leave. Sorry but the experience sucked. SUCKED. I ordered the Chuychanga, though and it was excellent. I devoured my entire plate. My fiancé got the Baja tacos which you cant ever get wrong. Sooo good.",1

1916408,5,"I LOVED this place, and I wasn't really expecting to since I am a taco snob. Meaning that I much more so prefer to give my money to mexican restaurants owned by Latinx folks because I think we do a great job as a society loving Mexican/Latinx culture + food, but white people profit that more than folks from that actual culture. 

That said, I still went during the opening days because I love free tacos. And I was surprised - I really enjoyed my experience.

The bartender on April 11 was AWESOME. I saw at the bar and he was busy, friendly, and took good care of me. The taco ordering system is different, and made me think of WhichWhich since you write down what you want. I appreciate how that makes it easier to order, especially for folks who have issues with verbal communication in a loud restaurant. The options are VERY different and nothing like I see in other taco places in Indy - hence, due to originality I am okay with this place because it really is just different.

I had the fiery Lucy taco and also a different one with cabbage that was good. My favorite was the one I built my own. I LOVE the Cheesey Gordita Crunch at Taco Bell but also Taco Bell is kinda unhealthy and gross, so I don't go there very much at all. But here I was able to get the crunchy shell + cheese + flour tortilla that I LOVE.

Basic tacos are $3.50 but they can go up to $5 or more if you add on a lot. However, the tacos are PACKED so that is pretty awesome.

The eggrolls were good but the springrolls were overly generous with the shredded lettuce and overly sparing on the meat.  One tiny sliver of meat and the rest was lettuce filler.

My steak is always prepared correctly. I recommend the ribeye, any size, or the prime rib (same cut of meat, different preparation). 

Here's a hint regarding any steak house: the best, flavorful cuts of steak usually have a moderate amount of fat in them. These are ribeye/prime rib and T-bones. The T-bone is also divided into two other familiar steaks: The New York Strip and the Filet.  

The leaner cuts, such as sirloin, are great if you are on a low-fat diet and they are also cheaper, but they are not as satisfying as a ribeye or prime rib. It may cost you $5 more, but you will taste the difference. 

Another thing to note is that in most steak houses, all food is made in-house. That means sides, dressings, croutons, everything is prepared on the premises. No bags of croutons or bottled dressings. Roadhouse is no exception.

Although incredibly tempted on the hot chicken pizza, decided my gut probably couldn't handle it. Ordered the Hot Chicken Sandwich ($11) and an IPA to wash it down ($5). when they say two handed, they are not kidding. Large bun sandwiching a thick cut chicken breast soaked in hot sauce, accompanied by lettuce, tomato, etc. Each bite is crisp and tender; hot sauce isn't overwhelmingly spicy, just the right kick. Fries are your regular thin-cut fare, fine with the ketchup provided. Filling meal overall.

Service here is timely and the atmosphere bodes well for conversation. Hopefully get to try the pizza someday.",1

2094382,5,"One of the best choices we ever made when moving into this area was making ICCU our bank for just about everything. But what we want to give them a high-five for has been their loan department's efficiency thru the 3 houses we have bought here. 

In one case, we wanted them to issue and close a loan in 3 weeks. Now most people don't realize that 3 weeks is warp speed to initiate, appraise, vet the borrowers, and approve the loan. So why the need for speed, you ask? Well, by closing before the April 15 deadline for the homeowner's property tax exemption on about a $100K of assessed value. We asked if they could meet that deadline and they said, Yes.

The fact that we had made ICCU our checking and cash savings institution made it easy for them to vet us.

In the last month, we saw a nice, smaller house that would meet our maturing needs. With the competitive market for house purchases now in place, we made the decision to buy before we sold our current house, so as to preclude being a ""contingent buyer"". That required us to ask if ICCU would find us credit worthy enough to loan us on the new house before we sold the current house? If they said yes, we would make our offer post haste. 

Mark G., the loan officer at the Ustick branch gave us a quick yes and started the paper work post haste. We bid, got it that night and ICCU finished our loan and closed the purchase in a few days under 3 weeks, beating their previous time. They are a great outfit to do business with.

To close out the tale, we sold our house a few days before we listed it (due to our great RE agent, Lynnette G of the Meridian Silver Creek office on Wells)and will be in the clear and not owning 2 houses. 

Thanks again to Mark G. And ICCU for making this possible.",1

It actually began to snow, so maybe the staff was depressed because of that. I'm trying to be optimistic here. But like i said, the food was good. We experimented with all of the tacos. Off the top of my head, the brisket, Memphis, fish and carnitas tasted great. Tried the chicken, but it tasted more like a wrap than a taco. But the others tasted amazing. The place is clean. They have sweet tea (easiest way to my heart). Gave them another try, and the staff was extremely pleasant, it was sunny outside. So find a day that's not too dreary and go check them out.",1

4065901,5,"Since my first visit to Farmers' Cabinet last week, I've already been back twice. This review is regarding my experience at the bar only, since I've yet to eat there. When Phoebe is on the roster, you know you're in good hands. I've sampled several of the cocktails, including the beer-inspired selections, and there really is something for everyone on the list. Well, except for that guy who foolishly asked for a bloody Mary the other night. Maybe not him. 

Bar snacks make a triumphant and interesting return in the form of sometimes sweet, sometimes spicy (sometimes a little of both!) popcorn and roasted barley. My digestive system thanks Farmers' Cabinet for the unexpected fiber supplement with my liquor.

The old-timey decor is stellar, and I've noticed more and more people dressing the part of Prohibition-era rebels. Best of all, though, is the band, Drew Nugent and the Midnight Society. The dapper outfits, the old-school microphone, the horns and the lead singer's Eddie Cantor-like vocals are just perfect. Even a song called ""My girl's p***y"" had people grinning ear to ear and singing along during a Friday night performance. 

I adore this place.",1

My friend and I ordered The Eccentric, which sounded weird (squash, zucchini), but also intriguing. My only complaint is that when they brought the pizza out they had only cut the pizza in half, not in slices. When I asked the waitress, she was shocked and rushed it back to have it cut properly.  Apparently the guy in the back had just received an order and just forgot. They threw in a couple breadsticks as compensation.  The pizza itself was flavorful, but my favorite part was the crust. Even my friend, who doesn't normally eat pizza crusts, ate the entire thing. 

The prices were not too bad and my service was fast...but then again I was eating at a weird time. Overall, however, I would recommend this place.",1

The portion sizes are generous and we probably could have split one entree. But both options were amazing! Loved the hot chicken! The only con was that the place is really small.

4587208,3,"The best thing that sums up my experience here is ""inconsistent"". My husband and I ordered tom yum and tom khar soups, Thai chicken wings, panang curry and pad Thai. All with chicken. And all medium spice level. 

The soups were boiling hot, but had no spice. The tom khar was initially kind of watery, and the tom yum tasted mainly like salt. We got some chili oil and after spicing them up, it brought out a few of the more subtle flavors in each soup. However, the chicken was strange. My husband liked his? But mine had these black markings on it, it looked like faded sharpie. I did not eat any more of the meat in the dishes after that. The wings were super hot (temperature) and super crispy. But other than the dipping sauce, they had no seasoning whatsoever. My husbands panang curry was delicious- and spicy! My pad Thai was incredibly bland. It needed more heat, more sweet and more sour/lime. I ate a little under half, with some of my husbands curry on top.

The service was okay. I had to go up to the counter and wait before I was noticed for the chili oil. But our drinks got several refills. One complaint was that the chicken came out before we were finished our soups and then the rest of the food came about 3 minutes later. So we were trying to eat everything at once. We probably wouldn't come back, but wouldn't be opposed if someone else suggested it!",1

The chicken had flavor and the skin was crispy...but it was just like regular ol' fried chicken with some spice on it.

They offered me a table, but I asked if I could sit at the bar. I took the end spot by the door and servers station and had a great time. 

I didn't want a heavy lunch, so I just went with an order of Chicken Nachos. I always add jalapeños to my order. Johnathan my server asked if I wanted pickled or roasted.  What? I've never been offered an option before. I showed him a picture of my last order and he said those are the pickled. I then asked him, which did he recommend and he said, roasted. I said, ""let's do it your, way"". OMG, I'll never go back to pickled again. The fire roasted jalapeños made the nachos, so much better then the standard pickled. 

He also, recommend the Ultimate Margarita. The ultimate is 50% tequila. Now that is the way to celebrate, NMD.

The office is spacious  and clean, with a large seating area with comfy chairs and an awesome plush carpet. My son couldn't resist taking a role across it plush carpet. They offer several services including  chiropractic services message, acupuncture and physiotherapy. 

Despite the appointment being delayed a half hour I left her office feeling satisfied with the visit. Dr. Khamba really took the time to listen and asked the questions that needed to be asked. What she recommended were some simple vitamins and  probiotics. She also recommended a food sensitivity test called IgG. Which I will let you all know is not covered by my health insurance plan and is a wee bit pricey. (Although well worth it from what I can tell from my research) Above all I really got the sense that she cares about her clients and has a passion  for what she does.

If you're considering becoming more proactive about your health I would definitely recommend a visit with Dr. Khamba. Her approach is mainly diet based. No voodoo snake oil stuff here.

 My friend who has a gazillion allergies and suffers from eczema and frequent illnesses has seen huge improvements in her health since seeing Dr. Khamba.

Phoned in order for standard pad Thai and the Chiang Mao noodle with a side of ginger fried rice. Two minutes walk in and seeing how Belle Chasse Hwy may not be pedestrian friendly prompted an embarrassing drive down. 

Outside of the entrance you are greeted by the word THAI.  If you get close to the entrance then you will know it is BB. 

Was a few min early and was greeted by nice waiter. He was very polite and prompted it was coming. Two min in he placed it on the table and I went on merry way. 

MK noodle was awesome!!!!!!!!! It's like a super saucy curry noodle, not thick gravy maybe more like soupy consistency? It was sweet seasoned well not much veggies but I was impressed. Crunchy noodles are placed on the side so it was fun to add it at the end to sop up extra soupy sauce. 

Only had bite of the ginger fried rice but it was amazing!!!!! Original intent was to eat it with the leftover sauce but it would ruin the delicate flavor.

We waited to be seated in a lobby area with cocktail menus, but no server to take a drink order. No biggie, but a missed opportunity to tag an extra $30 or so to our bill.

We were seated and our main waiter, Richard, came by. He didn't introduce himself (assistant waiter told us his name), didn't smile, and seemed rather stern. That was the vibe from him the rest of the night and it's not what I'm used to at nice restaurants in New Orleans.

The assistant server, Louis, was great! Introduced himself, friendly, checked to make sure we were good.

After a full 15 minutes with our drinks, I flagged the team and Richard came over. I said, ""Can we put in an order for food?"" to which he replied, ""Okay,"" and left it there. No addressing that we had been waiting, no introduction of the menu. I ordered brioche for the table and my entree. ""What would you like as a first course?"" I looked at the menu to see where first courses were listed and only saw the appetizer list which is what I assume he meant. I told him I was good with just the entree. He reconfirmed that I didn't want anything else and gave a surprised reaction. Next person orders and declines an appetizer. He sells us an appetizer in such a strange way, something to the effect that we should really order one because the entrees will take a long time. A better sell would have been to suggest an appetizer or two that shouldn't be missed.

He was really just so inhospitable and unfriendly, it was just strange! The group of us laughed about it throughout the meal. But the food and the rest of the service was so excellent, we'll be back - and I'll update this review then because I'm sure it'll be a five star experience.",1
4974735,3,"This place was within walkin distance from my house when I lived in Lansdowne. They had pretty good cheesestaks, horrible hoagies and even worse pizza.  This was the place I used when we had snowstorms, and I didn't feel like digging out my car out of the driveway.",1
6661009,5,"I used to live fairly close to High Hat and go somewhat frequently with my roommates, but I haven't been in a while.  So this past weekend, my SO and I decided to go for a long walk and go to Sarita's down the block.  Well, we forgot Sarita's was closed on Sundays, so we went to High Hat instead.  

We were told there as about a 10-15 minute wait, so we went to get seats at the bar, but ended up waiting about 5 minutes for seats there.  Just as we were about to sit, the host came and found us and told us a table for 2 just opened up.  Perfect!

We started with one of the specialty drinks (non-alcoholic) - satsuma mint lemonade.  It was very sweet, pretty minty, and wholly refreshing.  We also got a couple tamales to start.  They were seasoned well, cooked well, and had a good amount of meat for my liking.  One of my biggest peeves is a tamale that's all cornmeal, so I was quite pleased with this one.
We then split the flat-top catfish plate with bacon green beans.  The dish had 4 catfish fillets and a decent helping of green beans.  And we were quite satisfied, but not too full to walk the 3 miles back home.
Our server was very friendly and personable, and we left happy.",1

I got a good price on the room for SB prices, $134 a night.  The rooms and the grounds were very neat and clean.  You can go to the breakfast room and get breakfast and then go sit out on a bench by the pond and feed the ducks.  We used the pool and spa every night.  It was a great stay.  I would stay here again.",1
6782714,5,"I have been to Stockyard approximately 4 times now and let me tell you, this is exactly what you need after a long evening consuming far too many adult beverages. We get their breakfast sandwiches, usually with the Philly baguette or potato bun, throw some bacon on that bad boy and definitely the cheddar cheese.

if you're taking it home, do sauces on the side. The hot sauce is a little too vinegary but the stock sauce gives a nice little tang to the already savory sandwich. I am a big over easy egg girl but they will inevitably have ruptured prior to your consumption if you're taking it to go.


GET THE BREAKFAST POTATOES! They are worth it and are by far the best potatoes in Philly.",1

4912014,5,"My personal mission this year is dine at all of the establishments in Philadelphia and on the Main Line that were in the running for 'Best Sushi.' 

I absolutely love this restaurant. The food is outstanding and so far, no other restaurant has come close to comparing with Kotatsu. Kotatsu has a large menu with a lot of variety. It's a great place for everyone in the family because they don't only serve sushi; it's a steakhouse, sushi bar, and they also serve other traditional Japanese and Chinese items. 

On the menu: raw sushi rolls, cooked sushi rolls, vegetarian sushi rolls, and sashimi are all in separate sections so that the ""beginner"" sushi eater or those with more particular taste will have an easy time selecting something appropriate. There are also creative rolls such as Volcano roll, Sunset Miami, Hawaiian roll, Rock N Roll, and Crazy Roll. 

Kotatsu is also well-known for their house salad. They even sell their salad dressing by the pint. The service at Kotatsu is excellent. The restaurant itself has a versatile and spacious atmosphere.

Try the lunch and dinner buffet on Mondays and Wednesdays. All you can eat sushi (and a variety of other offerings such as salad, edamame, dumplings, egg rolls, and shrimp and vegetable tempura) for a little over $25/person.  

All this and BYOB...",1
3442391,5,"Rincon Country West RV Resort is a perfect park in Tucson for rigs of all sizes and plenty of room for towed vehicles and other toys. The price of $21 per night is the rate for our one month stay. I extended a few more days and I got the monthly rate for those days too. That is how it should be but many times is not the result. When we arrived I told them I have a 38 foot Monaco with a motorcycle lift holding my Triumph and our CR-V tow car. I explained I used my motorcycle for my Patriot Guard Riders armed forces veteran's missions. I always tell the office staff about my motorcycle and I've never been charged for an extra vehicle which I really appreciate. I stayed in space 1104 and the only thing I would do differently is ask for a North facing site instead of South. My power awning was broken so no awning in 80 plus weather everyday and facing South is not good, but at the end of the day I'll be returning to Portland golden brown! My fault not their fault and if I had been willing to move I am real sure they would have given me another site.
 
There is a beautiful pool and 2 spas and lots of room at the site, wonderful friendly people and great water pressure so you'll probably want to have your pressure regulator ready. I was leaving Easter Sunday so I went to pick up a package at the RV Post Office on Good Friday; However, the post office closed early that day, but another person retrieving his mail from his box, spoke into his mail box and asked if anyone was in the post office to help me. As it turns out the post master lady was still there and retrieved my package. This is what you can expect at Rincon Country West...Fellow RVers that are helpful and resort staff of the same helpful mindset. If I didn't have 6 kids in Portland Oregon I'd live here full time!

Finally I want to make sure I mention all the activities for your enjoyment. Trust me this is the tip of the iceberg. One day there'll be an Indian food truck, next day German, next day Mexican, next day something else. At night there will be concerts, free movies or some other entertainment. All day long there are classes and camaraderie for all people covering virtually every hobby. You can partake in as much as you wish or as little. The office staff and the big rig friendly layout of the RV Park make this the perfect place to stay in Tucson and I can't wait to visit next year!",1
2339114,3,"There is much to like here. During a trip to the farmers' market, we had both a on-street special grilled cod sandwich and the salmon poke salad.  The first was a great value at $10, given that it came with roasted potatoes and a drink. The $18  salad was very tasty, had a good helping of raw salmon in a spicy mayo and was generally pleasing. If it had been a little less expensive or come with a drink or small dessert, I would have been happier.  $18 is a lot for fast food salad.",1

She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant. 

Blonde hair isn't easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.

As someone who comes from Asian mecca (San Gabriel Valley & LA), I was skeptical coming to Kimchi Korean BBQ. All the past reviews below 3 stars were from management long ago. THIS Kimchi Korean BBQ, and THIS management is absolutely great and each of my experiences have been positive. To my knowledge, there is not another AYCE (all you can eat) KBBQ spot in town.

I typically go on the weekends and past a certain time the only offer options 2 & 3 which are the pricer options. The restaurant IS on the smaller side so expect to have a wait during busier times of the day. if you don't know what KBBQ is, you will typically order what you want and cook your own meat on the grill in front of you. Besides meat, there are plenty of other dishes you can order (steamed egg, kimchi fried rice, dumplings, vegetables, fish cake). 

The quality of meat is pretty good and the marinade is good. The service is IMPECCABLE and my water was always refilled. 

I definitely recommend SBnatives to come check out this place if you haven't before, it is a lot of fun sitting with friends and grilling your own food. The Korean cuisine and kimchi flavors are amazing and you will be happy with your experience here. 

They DO have an axxess deal, so take advantage!

But if glazed donuts aren't your thing, they have cake donuts, frosted cupcakes, brownies, and pies.  Long's also has anisette cookies at time as well, which are difficult to find.

Drinks? So many specials. Happy Hour will get you $2 wells and domestic drafts, $3 cocktails, and more. Even without the drink specials, you can expect to pay less here.

First of all, Datz is by far my favorite restaurant in Tampa. If you want to pig out on extremely tasty and creative food, eat here. It's been featured on Food Network and other foodie shows before and deserves the spotlight. Everything about Datz is unique (which I will breakdown in a few seconds), but I really cannot stress how you must try this place if you've never been. You will not be disappointed. I never once had a bad day here. And if you like bacon, you've entered heaven.

ATMOSPHERE: Located on South Macdill in Tampa, it is away from the Soho strip and nestled where Macdill turns into one lane. The parking lot is small so seek alternate parking on side streets during busy times (which is often). Datz is connected to sister establishment Dough which serves mostly desserts/psychotically awesome donuts and some small sandwiches at lunchtime. The inside of the restaurant is dark and elegant. It is 2 stories with a balcony style second floor. There is bar seating on both floors and a good amount of tables on both as well. There is a bakery counter near the front of the store displaying their ridiculous creations. Upstairs you'll find a wall of interesting liquor bottles. There are TVs in the bar areas only. Getting a seat can take a long time, especially on weekends but it is well worth the wait. Grab a drink while you wait! Bathrooms and the rest of the restaurant is clean and well maintained. Servers are friendly and know their stuff as do the bartenders. Service can be slow during busy times too so be patient and wait for your food...WORTH IT. 

DRINKS: There are not many bars in Tampa that have a unique beer selection to compete with Datz. You'll find an outstanding list of craft beers anytime you go. They always have some good finds from Cigar City, Funky Buddha, Founders, Bell's, Stone and basically anywhere that is featuring a rare beer. They are really reasonably priced. The featured beers are usually around $6 and other can run $5-$10 depending on availability/rarity. There is also a full liquor bar and they make their cocktails very well. These are on the higher priced side at $10-$13. During brunch, you should try the Bloody Mary for $10...it includes bacon and their famous Bloody Mary mix. Go Monday to Friday from 3-6pm for $4 local beers, $5 cocktails and $6 glasses of good wine. The selection of liquors and wines is impressive for even the snobbiest drinkers. 

FOOD: Do yourself a favor...come here hungry AF and look at the menu beforehand on their website. It takes forever and a day to decide between the options because EVERYTHING is amazing!! Many dishes have bacon, but do not fear if you are a vegetarian because there are plenty of options for you too. Appetizers are all outstanding, but my favorite selection is the Mac Bites. They have bacon and jalapeno mac and cheese fried into scrumptious balls and served with sriracha aioli. Drooooooooool! I've also had the black truffle fries, datchos and monkey bread. All amazing, but share with the table and try not to fill yourself because your meal is going to be effing awesome! FYI - If you make it to Happy Hour, the apps are half price! Onto the main dishes which are more than most bellies can handle. AKA - you're getting a to-go box for a second satisfying dose of Datz later. The sandwiches are mostly massive and packed full of flavor. Very very very unique combinations and pretty much all homemade in house ingredients. I've had the Havana Hottie, Carolina on My Mind, Ty's Two Fister, Dumb Cluck, Smokey and the Bird and April in Paris. Couldn't pick a favorite. They were all perfect. All come served with Datz homemade potato chips with a blue cheese drizzle. Mmmmmmmmm. I haven't tried a house salad or house favorite entree, but I've seen others around me roll their eyes in a foodgasm when eating theirs. Never seen a sour face or a returned plate from dissatisfaction. If you can make it to dessert, you should compete in a food challenge. But if you're taking something home you are in for a treat. The desserts are enormous and decadent. Stop by the dessert counter just to look!

I think I have exhausted all I can think of at this point. If you don't read anything else, read this: GO TO DATZ. YOU'LL BE HAPPY :)",1
2015421,5,"i work in tucson and live out of town, so a hotel is a must.  after some...(ahem) adventurous stays at meth head central and ghetto united, i resolved to find a great extended stay hotel at a great price.  i'm not a person who needs a resort the level of the scottsdale biltmore or the beverly hilton; i am quite happy with a basic, no frills room.  more funds to have more fun...like shopping!!   :)
EUREKA!!  it exists...in the tucson studio 6.  the staff are absolutely wonderful, and the rooms...well, if someone blindfolded me and took me here and removed the blindfold and challenged me to guess what hotel i was at, i would be hard pressed to even consider guessing studio 6.  hardwood floors, fully stocked kitchenette, fluffy pillows, and comfy beds are ready and waiting...and the rooms and grounds are immaculate.
best-kept bargain hotel in tucson!  a-plus--and then some!!",1

The old fashion is a bit sweet, but overall pretty good. They have limited outdoor seating but there's plenty of seating inside. Happy hour is decent as well.",1
2285686,4,"Not my regular stop since I am not often over in this part of town, but if I see something I like in their sale ad and I am passing through I will stop and get it.

The people working here all seem nice. They helped me pick out the right tequila for making margaritas, and it was on sale. 

I like how I can push my shopping cart right into the beer cooler to get cold cases.

They have bag ice in several different sizes from small bags all the way up to huge sleeves.

They also seem to have everything else. I find the odd variety cases of things that most other stores don't carry. Bought a case of ""Beers of Mexico"" on sale.

Lastly, I have only been here a handful of times, but I have never had to wait in a long line. Service at the checkout is quick, even on holidays.",1

694989,4,"Five stars for the ambiance, four for the food, and one for flexibility of menu.

I had breakfast there on a busy morning. Tried to order an omelette but since no omissions/substitutions are allowed, I ended up with two eggs scrambled and a delightfully fluffy almond croissant. Although I didn't get what I'd wanted, I didn't leave disappointed. It was a very tasty meal and the portions were generous; there were more than two eggs used, I'm guessing, and they even came with a bit of garlic bread. The filling in that almond croissant was some of the best I've tried. 

And it's just such a charming spot to relax and eat... So quintessentially New Orleans with the statues and brick and the live jazz band. The seating is plentiful too, so I didn't even have to wait. Definitely a worthwhile experience.",1

Coffee: medium roast, aromatic and not too bitter.  It's the way I like it!

Pumpkin cheesecake: homemade served with fresh cream on a cashew gingersnap crust. 
It was delicious, not too sweet and not heavily spiced.

Between the amazing smell when you first walk in, the encyclopedic array of spices, and hands on service, it really is hard to find another place like this in town.  The staff was super attentive and very informative on all the option. Their recommendations are always spot on.  For this particular visit, the highlights for me were all the salt free options they offered. It's worth a pilgrimage down to maplewood and the hassle that comes with the parking.",1
232494,4,"This is one of my favorite in N'lean. The Sunday Buffet is spectacular. If you are looking for the exemplary typical cajun soul food, this is the place. I'm not too much into places that like to redefine the classics. I like places that pay homage to the way foods cook the old fashion way, and Lil D is such a place. Use good ingredients, pay attention to details, and cook like you care. The fried chicken is juicy inside, crispy outside, and seasoned just right. The gumbo and jambalaya are flavorful. The classic Mac, collar greens, and beans are also good.",1
758658,4,"Food was delicious.  Menu is seasonal.  Kitchen takes risks with interesting flavor combinations like grapefruit and feta or perfectly cooked amberjack with blood orange and olive.  Brown butter banana tart was executed perfectly.

They fix what they say they are going to fix - this is the second time I've had a vehicle worked on by Greg's Garage and the second time I've been satisfied with the work. 

They charge what they say they are going to charge. 

They will pick up and drop off your vehicle.

They do a General once over of things that might need work and go over them with you. 

They aren't the cheapest place I've ever had work done, but sometimes you get what you pay for.

They are a locally owned shop and they are friendly.",1

They have really good sandwiches here and wraps, we both had the roast beef and Asiago, with garlic.  The garlic was no way overpowering, in fact I could barley taste it. The sandwich came in a Ciabatta bun, and was very good.  Hit the spot and went down well with the Venice coffee. If you stop in before Christmas, they have alot of great gift ideas, and gift baskets and cookies etc.. If you need a quick gift in a hurry and have no time to go to the mall, Second Cup has some nice ideas for gift giving..",1

1308513,3,"Pretty disappointing. My friend and I didn't mind the 45 minute wait since it was Sunday at peak brunch time but the food was such a let down starting with the drinks. I ordered the blueberry lavender lemonade and she the arnold palmer. All I could taste in my ""lemonade"" was blueberry syrup. No lemonade, really no lavender. Not fresh at all; I couldn't finish it. My friend's arnold palmer was also too sweet to finish. 

For entrees we ordered the challah french toast with fried potatoes (homies) and huevos rancheros. My friend really enjoyed her huevos rancheros but my french toast was bland and my potatoes were flavorless and dry. 

It was our first time at Sabrina's so we weren't sure if things were different due to covid but it wasn't the best for us. The wait staff was very nice.",1

They are also great at accommodating groups.",1

So happy with the quality & taste of their ice cream. Too bad it was during the pandemic, I did not have an opportunity to taste test  but 100% satisfied with their Turkish Coffee & Vanilla Bean.

Your husband will make friends. They share a common interest. And of course, there are lots of fun tournaments that they get involved in. It really is a great place. 

I'm not yet invested in this hobby (my husband keeps saying he'll get me into it eventually) but I can say it is a wonderful store. Big John was very friendly, they have lots of products, and unlike other stores (*cough* the mall) they have all the paint colors that you can need. 

Support Local! 

Drop the hubby off and there is a nail salon a few stores down if you want some *lady time* while the boys play.",1

We've been searching for very specific subtle, fragrant, aromatic, just-right-spiceness Thai-Laotian food since moving here from Southern California. Oh my! We have found it.

Nearly hidden near the rear, behind narrow aisles piled high with boxes of imported foods, oodles of noodles, stacks of sweets and other treats, plus sundry Far Eastern groceries and baked goods, you'll find the King Market Cafe and a world of delicacies one step short of Nirvana (absolute blessedness). Okay....maybe that's a bit over the top. But for us, this place has other local Thai restaurants beat hands down.

Yes...the location is 2-stars, the seating is 3.5, but the service is 5 full stars. (Thank you Suda, especially for being so congenial, full-of life, and cheerful - working on your birthday no less!) On top of that, our late-to-RSVP group of 14 showing up unexpectedly - the entire staff could not have been more gracious.

Now on to the food. From appetizers to entrées the portions are generous to say the least. Filled with flavor bombs via artful and true-to-Thai cuisine we sampled delicate and aromatic freshly made Spring rolls, crisply fried golden brown squid, and entrees ""to dine for.""

I stuck with one of my all-time favorites, Pad Kra Pao with chicken, a stir fried dish featuring Thai-Basil (sometimes called Holy Basil and its hints of licorice and heat). You also can order it with pork or beef or tofu. This dish is considered by many to be the all-time favorite Thai street food; it certainly is mine. The moist, tender chicken was folded into beautiful thin-sliced broccoli, jalapenos, snow pea pods, bell peppers, Thai chilies and slivers of onion. The flavors from the House Sauce (likely added garlic and umami-like oyster sauce) were as close to perfection as I can imagine. (And I'm drooling as I recount this epicurean experience.)

Other guests' choices - Crab Wontons filled with cream cheese and (sadly) imitation crab, fried shrimp - sweet and crispy, Pad Phet (similar to my dish but with bamboo shoots and peppercorns), and fried fish. (The menu says Mackerel, but the fish served appeared to be Perch or Tilapia.) My wife chose a bowl of Pho with chicken. (Again, you also can order with beef, pork, tofu, shrimp, or seafood.) And here's where the generous portion sizes are demonstrated to the max. The ""small"" beef broth and rich with rice noodles Pho bowl was enormous. And after eating a substantial portion, she took the rest home in a styrofoam container. That carry-out left-over amount was a quart and a half! 

Price for this entrée ... $7.50. Other dinners - which also include about a cup and a half to two cups of rice! - ran about $8.00. And the fresh Spring Rolls were 2 for $2.00! Honest-to-goodness fantastic flavor food at street food prices!

It simply does not get any better than this. 

(Thank you for such a wonderful meal.)",1
625205,3,"This place used to be a Radison owned property and includED Sleep Number beds, they have since taken the SN beds out but for the most part, everything is still the same. The first time we stayed, our room over looked the pool and was quite quaint. This time, our room (3067) over looked the Cracker Barrel and two stories above the restaurant which hosted a very loud country band the room is not sound proof to say it lightly.

Pros: location, directly across the street from the Gaylord Resort and convention center.
Free parking
Almost $100 less per night (during the Christmas season, which is when I priced both places)
Several dining options onsite or within walking distance 
Shuttle bus

Cons: shuttle bus to the Gaylord only runs until 7:30 pm even on the weekends. 
The shuttle bus to downtown is $20 per person.
The noise level
Price is still steep, in my opinion.
Small children in the hot tub...I know that isn't the hotel's problem, I just hope that someone will read that part and refrain from allowing their children in the hot tub. 
Parking is hard to find after 8pm...on the weekends.",1

2476888,5,"In the city known for their Cheese steaks you will never be disappointed if you select Jim's. First lets clear something up - Pat's and Geno's great places, both unique and with their own style from the way the meat is served up to the bread it squished in to. However, Jim's just takes it all the way home! 

My fav location and unfortunately a trendy spot for tourists is this South Street location. When I visit Philly I visit Jim's. I love going home just to spend that time in line anticipating the juicy steak sandwich that is coming my way! 

In order to not embarrass yourself or have instant anxiety be prepared to shout the order and don't forget KISS (keep it simple stupid). For example leave out the um's, ugh's and what's. Just tell 'em how you want it dressed. For example: provolone, peppers and onions, and hot peppers. That's it. You don't have to say ""I would like a cheese steak with lettuce, tomato, fried onions and peppers and cheese whiz"" Just say ""in the garden, fried onions and pepper w/ whiz"" That's it! Then be prepared to devoured the best greasy but tasty sandwich you've ever had!! :) 

Once you weave your way through the line, oh and enjoy looking at the pictures all over the walls of celebrity status people who have have the privilege to dine at Jim's. Once you have food in hand, the issue becomes where to sit. You might have a bite before your butt hits the chair! You can venture to second floor where you will find condiments like mustard and ketchup. There will be about 10 tables or so and the windows overlook South street down below. Be safe on these stairs, a bit steep!! If sitting on the second floor is a no go and the little bar style seating on the first floor is another dead end, grab your food head outside to the curb, sit down and EAT! 

BTW they ship!!!! I have yet to try this feature unfortunately I like the real deal straight off the grill!",1

Our visit was a weekend earlier this month when businesses and people were ready and excited to bust out of the COVID way of living. Streets and businesses were extremely busy with people smiling and laughing - it was so exciting and refreshing to see life happening again. Unfortunately, my experience at The Stillery was disappointing which I was surprised given the great number of positive reviews. I ordered the Hot Chicken Salad. It took over 30 minutes for us to get our food, but that was understandable given how packed the restaurant was. The drinks were pretty watered down - tasteless - so I didn't ordered a second one. The salad was very dry from the chicken being dry and without flavor or heat. The salad also had hardly any salad dressing - it looked bare. The salad simply lacked taste. Although the chicken wasn't really hot, as in being spicy, I concentrated on eating it and then pushed away what was left behind. I'd be willing to give The Stillery another try if I'm ever back in the area, but I definitely won't order this salad again.",1

Three of us shared crab rangoon, pad Thai with shrimp, and mango curry with chicken. The crab rangoon was overrated - undercooked, with far too little crab and far too much cream cheese (and ""too much cheese"" is something that has never come out of my mouth before). The curry and pad Thai were not bad, with very fresh veggies, but not much more to say than that. 

The service was lackluster - slow, lacking personality, and just kind of oblivious. I'm not sure if our server was a hostess or kitchen staff that they had to press into serving, but given that we were the only table, it could've been significantly better.

Although we decided to carry out, it was nice to see that kids are welcomed. 

If you're a Cubs fan, you're in luck! There's memorabilia here and they obviously tune into the games at the bar. The place isn't big, but there's plenty of room to sit around the bar or at the tables.

We heard the wings were amazing and they definitely are!!! They are smoked, which means they didn't need any sauce to go on them. They were tasty as is. The Fat Dan burger was HUGE and pretty tasty as well! There's a large amount of fries they give you in a small. That size feeds two.

I'm so glad I came here! I'll definitely return.",1

The stuffed mushrooms were SO GOOD. I could have eaten a whole order by myself. My friend got the fish tacos which looked amazing and she said the fish was super crunchy. I got the steak sandwich on garlic cheese bread, that bread was so soft, the steak cooked to medium as I requested. The restaurant is properly air conditioned, tables and booth are spaced out, very good for social distancing. Service was friendly.",1

301903,4,"You can't start a review of Olivier's without talking about how the meal starts....with that decadent corn bread with honey butter -- it is simply amazing! The rest of our meal was very good too. My wife was split between the duck and their signature dish, rabbit, and decided on the duck. She rated is as within the top three duck dishes she's ever had, which is a very high rating.

I had the Creole Trio, but based on some reviews below and my dislike for crawfish etoufee, replaced it with their gumbo. They were very accommodating about this change and didn't charge me extra for the switch. The jambalaya was good but was a limited portion, the blackened fish was very moist but didn't have a ton of flavor, and the gumbo was solid but not great.

Our waiter gave solid service throughout the evening and was on top of everything even though it was a full house on a Wednesday night. At the end of our meal, the restaurants software went down as we were going to pay, so they asked us to wait a few minutes while it came back up. As we were finishing up our drinks, it was not a problem and 5 minutes later it was fixed and they processed my credit card. Then the manager brought it back to our table and said, ""for your inconvenience we've taken the drinks off your bill."" That was super nice and not needed, but they wanted to make sure we had a positive experience so I give them kudos for being so customer service oriented.

The ambiance and atmosphere is as described on their web site or in many of the other reviews on this site. It is cool and very appropriate for the restaurant. Overall, we had a good experience and good food. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it wasn't amazing and there are so many good restaurants in New Orleans it seems that you have to be amazing to rate 5 stars.",1

This lamb burger was good tasting, very juicy and savory.  The server brings you the lamb burger on a delicious bun, next to a bed of fries and a pickle on the plate.

It made my mouth water as I watched the server bring it to the table.

I have to say this is the best lamb burger I ever had best of all burgers period.  I have never eaten  a lamb burger one before now and wished, I had been eating this, better than beef to me.

This was an amazing lamb burger with the succulent lamb meat and feta cheese sprinkled all over the top Lamb burger, giving it a very umami and flavor, the bun was delicious with the juices soaking in.  

The golden fries and on the plate made the entire dish look good with great presentation.

The main employee that helped me get the correct items for my truck was Dennis See.  He is knowledgeable and works his best to get you in to the earliest appointment that fits your schedule, without bumping others from theirs!

Been here a couple of times on different occasions, once for the Roar and Pour and the other as a simple guest. 
As the other comments say, it is a smaller zoo, but packed very efficiently. There are rolling hills and steep inclines in some areas. But I love how personal the zoo feels. 

This last visit was the best. We were there an hour before closing and all the animals were out and about. It was amazing seeing the animals running around playing with each other. We saw the 1yr old lion trying to play with its Dad only to have him roar then huff and buff into his man cave. And the absolute highlight was watching Marta playing with her mother. We were the only ones there. I just about lost it with cuteness overload, wish i could post the video of the two playing together. They were so close I could see little Marta's shoulders round as she got ready to pounce on her mom, I could see the little blinks, it was all too precious.",1

1952957,4,"The restaurant at Gold Dust Casino never disappoints.  Consistent quality food. Big portions, low and reasonable prices and great service. They deserve a shout out so, if you're looking for good food, great prices and service, breakfast, lunch or dinner...doesnt matter. They are on point for all. They even give you free pie.  Although, I'd have to say the pie is just so so. That's the only thing that could be improved. The dining room is large, during busy times you may wait for a table but the wait is never very long. If you have a large group they have two large,  private dining rooms. Today I had the club sandwich with potato salad. First time I've had their potato salad. So good!!! Like homemade. My dining partner had the chicken cesar salad. Something I've had several times. One of the best in town. He loved it. We also had Bloody Marys. Cheap and perfect.  Nice refreshing brunch drink! If you've passed up Gold Dust thinking it's nothing special  give them a shot. You won't be disappointed.",1

The house salad that came with our meals was second best. The dressing on the spinach was yummy and the fried oyster was cooked perfectly. I had the fried drum with shrimp étouffée, which was a little overwhelming flavor-wise. My husband got friend dark meat chicken and it was delicious. Our sides were pretty good but overall, I didn't feel like the quality of the meal was worth the wait.",1
5566453,4,"**This review is based solely on dessert crepes. I've never tried the savory crepes or drink menu**

When a place has you trying to recreate its recipes at home--that's when you know its a keeper! I've visited this place many times over, and I only foresee many more trips to come!

Food: Their rice flour crepes are so. freaking. good. It's not rubbery like a normal crepe; instead, there's a nice balance between crispy and chewy. All the crepes are made in front of you, and the fruit and veggie toppings look very fresh. A side note: I wouldn't recommend the Mango Raspberries crepe, since the mangoes were subpar and underripe (or try ordering in the summer, when mangoes are in season). My favorites are the matcha chocolate truffle and the matcha adzuki bean. 

Atmosphere: Love the dark wood and the surprisingly realistic crepe display encased in bell jars. I can definitely pick up and appreciate the Japanese-inspired vibes.

Pricing: 3/5. A crepe will set you back around $7-11, so it's not the cheapest dessert option, but I think that's a pretty fair price, given the freshness of ingredients and the hand assembly. I wish it was a smidge cheaper, but it is pretty filling and this is the only crepe place I've seen in Philly.

Tips: It's cash only for under $10, so be sure to bring cash or use their atm located right near the register.",1

484351,4,"This is an interesting shop to check out while visiting Irvington.  I was surprised to see it open late on a Sunday afternoon (their website says they aren't usually open on Sundays) and decided to stop in.

I'm not a religious person and don't believe in spells and potions and that sort of thing, but I do have respect for other individual's beliefs.  So wandering into here was something new to me.  They have lots of books and hundreds of herbs, they have incense and candles, lots of plants in the front window (not sure if those are for sale), and a room in the back for reading and classes.  They have bumper stickers with spiritual comments, sometimes humorous.  Basically, there are a lot of items to browse through that aren't like what you find in other places.  Apparently there are 50 artisans who provide their wares to the shop.

Some of my favorites: fried alligator, rabbit and dumplings, THE BREAD, and the mac and cheese 

Onto dessert, I really wanted to try the ice cream sandwich trio but they had ran out. After hearing that, I asked our server before dinner if he could save me a chocolate hazelnut pudding before hand because they sell out. And he said yes! By the end of the meal, he said they had sold it to another table by accident. They offered all of their desserts on the menu that they had. It was a nice gesture but the pineapple upside down cake was okay, sorbet was okay, and the peanut butter dessert was okay. My favorite dessert we had was the Dutch apple pie!

Their dishes had a great southern food influence to it. It's a must try when in NOLA.",1
1756403,3,"After working most of day, It was time to head our for cheesesteaks and not the cheezwhiz filled kind. Mind you Philly was 18"" deep in snow and counting. So after not seeing a cab, we took off for a walk. That sucked cuz all i had were three shirts and a towel(hat). We stopped here. No Jim;s or Ishcabibble open. 
I think the beer and whiskey for $4 might have bee reason the ""advance"" team popped in. I say cuz it was right across street from original destination.
I went with a slice of pie(pizza). It was like any other one can get in North Beach. Large cheese and taste. I got talked into/made to have the aforementioned special as a boilermaker. So down went PBR and well whiskey. I am told the cheesesteak was good here. It's a sense of bride with all places serving these sandwiches. It seemed a popluar place that day with a few people chowing down before a pub crawl.

In fact, the only real difference was that the dining room is now much warmer and more inviting, with interesting art by a well-known local painter on the walls. One cool aspect about this place is that it's very much below-the-radar, which is hard to believe considering its outstanding location. It is what it is. My appetizer was the clay-pot barbecued shrimp, which was more of a Spanish stew than a New Orleans barbecued shrimp (which of course bears absolutely no relationship whatsoever to the American definition of barbecue). It was quite good, although I was very jealous about the baked oysters with bacon, red peppers and parmesan that others ordered. My entree was absolutely outstanding. I had the gulf fish with lump crabmeat and jalapeno hollandaise. The only thing that didn't impress me was the bread pudding.",1

The atmosphere is spectacular- dark and cozy, pleasantly cramped. You will literally rub elbows with the people sitting near you! I admit I had a fun time eavesdropping on the conversations of the tableful of yuppies next to us. 

When we arrived we were told that the kitchen was backed up, and yep, it sure was! Our entire three-course meal took over two hours. 

The food was good but not great. We each had the ricotta appetizer- from the description of ""baked ricotta"" I thought it would be hot, but it wasn't. However, I enjoyed the seasoning in the vinaigrette. For my main course I had the cavatelli with tomato pesto. It was a perfect sized portion (a lot of people have commented that portions are small... that's true ONLY if you're going to compare it to the Olive Garden or something!), the pesto was tangy and flavorful, and the pasta tender and yummy. My fiance had the balsamic chicken special, and he said it was good. For dessert we had tiramisu and the strawberry filled cake and my fiance had a cup of coffee.

The service was great- I appreciated that they were up front about the kitchen being backed up, and the owner, Mark, came around a few times to make conversation. They also brought us as much bread as we wanted and plenty of delicious olive oil to dip.

5569148,3,"I haven't even checked into the hotel yet, but find the customer service to be egregious so far. I'm a Hilton honors member and traditionally stay at Hilton's. I specifically picked this airport because it's only 1.5 miles from the Philadelphia airport, so it makes it very convenient for flying in and out immediately. Having to literally wait OVER 35+ minutes for the ""complimentary"" shuttle is in my opinion, unacceptable. While I'm fine waiting a few minutes, when I called multiple times complaining to the front desk and inquiring where the shuttle was, they were completely useless. At this rate, the Doubletree should comp people their taxi ride to drive 1.5 miles away versus waste their time and inefficiently wasting their time with the shuttle. 

40 minutes later, now I'm taking a taxi.

OK, 2 hours later, I've calmed down and changed them from a 1 star to 3 star. I checked in fine after taking a taxi ($9 ride - totally worth it instead of waiting, btw). Check in fine and speedily. The hotel had a nice lobby with 2 water jugs filled with lemon and orange. The elevators are tiny (and would barely fit a wheelchair), but my room was clean, modern and had decent toiletries. 

The manager came and dropped off a complimentary breakfast a few hours later too, which went a long way.

2437705,5,"St. Louis is one of the nation's most unusual donut markets. Dominated by local donut shops, only recently has national mainstay Dunkin' Donuts tried to re-enter St. Louis after pulling out all together several years ago.

Among the best donut joints in all the STL is John's. Nothing pretentious here. Just great donuts. Even better, this donut shop is open overnight most nights.

The chocolate covered cinnamon rolls here are the best donuts in the house. Everything's good--but the chocolate cinnamon rolls are truly extraordinary. They're fluffy and filled with flavor. The spice of cinnamon and the wonderful waxy chocolate blend to create a flavor that's nothing short of perfect.  But if you want the best of the best at this donut shop, visit Tuesday - Friday and try the apple or cherry turnovers.  WOW!!!!!!!  I grew up in a town with a distinct German heritage back in Indiana, and apple turnovers were a prized tradition among the bakeries. Nothing I tasted in childhood or at any gourmet bakery comes close to John's turnovers. They're flaky and filled with flavor. Unlike many bakers who pack on the sugar, this little donut shop understands the perfect balance between tart and sweet.

Sometime the simple things in life deliver the greatest pleasure.  A well-executed apple or cherry turnover from John Donut confirms my theory on simplicity.",1

The french toast is the best thing ever. Best french toast in Tucson.
I love their egg specials too.
Their oatmeal is also excellent.

The only downside is that sometimes, they get busy -- so be ready to wait (this is because the food is so good)",1

Love supporting a small local business during Covid 19. Their online order system is also the best system I've used. Finally, they have some bomb ass ranch! You won't go wrong with anything you order here! Will definitely be coming back over and over! Don't sleep on Chubbies!",1
4656209,4,"Finally had the chance to check this place out. 
I noticed first that there is some outdoor seating and when we went they were grilling some burgers outside as well. We opted for indoors. 
Note that when you walk in you are supposed to go directly to the bar to order you food and drink, get a number and choose your seat.   They have a small menu of food and lots of beers. 
The food service is a little inefficient, with the servers having to look all over inside and out for the associated number. 
Food took quite awhile but it was hot and tasty when we got it.   The chorizo queso was really good with big chunks of chorizo and plenty of chips. For my sandwich, I opted for a grilled cheese with bacon.   It was a tasty sandwich with a generous amount of cheese.  
Kids were allowed in as well and there is live music some evenings.",1

2190433,5,"Last night I had the opportunity to check out the new Out Front Bar experience at Outback Steakhouse. One of only two Outback Steakhouses in the country to offer this concept, the location on Sheldon Road instantly proved that they are a different restaurant than the Outback I grew up with. I have a soft spot for Outback Steakhouse and change is something I have a problem with. This change, I will take.

We were warmly greeted by the Outback staff, who told us this was their first event of this kind. 50+ Elite Yelpers showed up excited to try out the new small plate concept. This concept was a home run. The menu consists of small plates ranging from $6-$9 and dessert lollipops (cake pops) for $2. Outback offers pitchers for two of their specialty cocktails, Wild Tea and a Down Under Tiki Punch. The small plate concept is designed for sharing multiple appetizers at a fraction of full portion pricing. With multiple long communal tables, it is perfectly designed for an after hours happy hour or a fun night out with friends. Another awesome concept at this restaurant was the cooking station above the bar. It had three mirrors, which gave a cooking show demonstration feel. You can watch your food being made while throwing back some cocktails.

We started off with two drinks - my boyfriend ordered the Sangria which was made with Moscato. It was a little sweet for my liking. For those who prefer sweet cocktails, this will be right up your ally. I ordered the cucumber margarita, with muddled cucumbers, agave, fresh basil, citrus juices and Patron. You know I love cucumber cocktails and I was happy that Outback is following this trend. If I could change one thing about this drink, I would have had a spicy or flavored salt rim, like the cucumber margarita at Epcot. It would take this delicious cocktail to the next level.

The first small plate we tried was the Beef Wellington. I love beef wellington but it is normally such a heavy dish so I wont order it out. This small portion consisted of woodgrilled filet mignon in a puff pastry with mushrooms and sauteed spinach. This was perfect amount to satisfy my Beef Wellington craving without making me feel guilty.

Followed by the Diablo. Hello Diablo, You were my favorite of the night. Wood grilled sirloin skewers over a croistini and a pepper steak sauce that was to die for. Whatever they put in that sauce, I would like to know so I can copy cat this recipe. It had some heat, but not too spicy.

Out next was hand breaded chicken bites. I will be honest, when I saw this on the menu, I wasn't excited. Then the plate came out and surprisingly  this was my second favorite dish of the night. It was perfectly breaded and seasoned. It reminded me of the batter from a Bloomin Onion and a chicken nugget had a baby. It was served with a creamy creole sauce.

We ordered two different cocktails that were offered. Gabe got the Wild Tea, which is available by the pitcher. Absolut Wild Tea, lemon and unsweetened iced tea are the ingredients to this concoction. I finally know what to do w/ that full bottle of Wild Tea sitting under my bar! I ordered the Forbidden Fruit Tini. This was a sweet martini that was stronger than you would imagine. Absolut Orient Apple Vodka, St-Germain Elderflower, Agave, white grape juice, lemon, cinnamon sugar and frozen grape garnish. Interesting, sweet, but good.

Now that we re-hydrated with adult cocktails, out came the Garlic Pepper Shrimp. Good thing, these were spicy. Spicier for my liking. I would give them a second chance as I feel around this time, I had so many things going on inside of my belly that I was losing interest in food.

After our mouths cooled down, we tried a Filet Flat Bread which had arugula and caramelized onions. And some Steakhouse Short Rib Nachos. This was an awesome dish. Crispy Kettle chips topped with BBQ seasoning, cheddar sauce and beef short ribs. Need I say more? 

Finally to top things off, a Slider. It was a baby version of Outbacks famous Cheeseburger. While I love sliders, I prefer mine seared so they are medium rare. This had an excellent sear but were well done. If I could get these cooked Medium rare, I would order them again.",1
2768014,5,"This was awesome!!!  We did the pirate ship and it was great fun.  I will say the people I went with was very determine not to fail!! lol  They had be crawling on the floor and probably putting my hand in unsanctioned zones!!! CTFU  Either way thru all the foolery we escaped!!

It was very clean and open...nice yellow walls, granite counter/bar for anyone who wants to sit and eat a slice, and a little flat screen tv built into the wall.

3607353,5,"I have been a craft beer fan for a while now (@drinkingcraft) but I've just recently started homebrewing and am a complete beginner so keep that in mind. With that said, I thought Great Fermentations was perfect for all home brewing needs. The inventory looked good and they seemed to have everything along with tons of clone and brewing kits. I am only aware of one other brew shop in Indy which is in Fountain Square so if you're on the north side this is the place. The guys inside were very quick to help with questions and were active around the store. I'm not sure how comparable the prices are as this is my first shop. Two big perks about this place that I personally enjoy are 1. there is a kegerator of local beer and free pours while you're in the shop. 2. Bier Brewery is literally 50 feet away in the same strip and that place is awesome. Definitely worth a growler fill after you hit up the homebrew store. I'm pretty sure the beer in the kegerator was from Bier also. We brewed a gumballhead clone about a month ago and dry hopped with some cascades I grew in the back yard this summer which turned out swell! So Great Fermentations gets an A on the first brew kit. Our second kit purchase was just bottled so we'll see how it turns out. It looked like they offer/have brewing classes which I haven't personally experienced but I'm sure would be great to learn the basics and pick up some tips. Overall, this place has everything needed to get the job done and then some. Don't think a better place exists in greater Indianapolis.",1
4296701,4,"This is no doubt a guilty pleasure (and great hangover remedy).  I don't care that it is a chain or that they sell glorified hot pockets, those who hate are lying.  The people are friendly and always ready to dole out calorie-rich goodness.",1
6340040,3,"Walking around Canal street on the hunt for some food, I stumbled upon this place. It is hard to miss as it is surrounded by a swirling mass of people, as if they were caught in some gravitational pull.

Despite the very long line, I was able to sit at the last seat at the bar (it pays to go solo sometimes). However, once I sat down, service was a little slow, In defense of the waitress, it was at capacity at around 25 people and she was the only person behind the bar. That is a fail on the part of management that couldn't predict a Saturday morning rush.  
 
While waiting, I pulled up Yelp and instantly saw my choice--the Eggs Blackstone. Pretty much eggs Benedict, but on a biscuit. If ever you should see something like this on the menu, get it!

After waiting a good 10 minutes, I got the menu and ordered my coffee. Another 10 minutes pass before actually getting my coffee and being able to order... which ended up breaking my heart--they were OUT OF BACON!!! 

Bacon being the proverbial glue that connects the eggs to the biscuit is an essential component of the Eggs Blackstone. And they didn't have any. Breakfast without bacon is like an earth without water: incapable of sustaining life. Without this, it is just eggs with tomato on some carbs. Unacceptable. In my sorrow, I ordered what appeared to be the closest thing--Eggs Cochon: slow cook pork debris served over an open-faced biscuit, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise.

True to its word, the slow cook pork came slowly. About to eat my hand off and having finished my coffee 5 minutes ago, this beast of a plate appeared before me. I didn't really know what to expect, but what I saw made me think of pulled pork in gravy sloppy joe, with poached eggs and sauce. Hiding beneath this mountain of fat and grease were some carbs in the form of soggy biscuits. While no means bad--and actually good at first--it was a bit much. A bit much for breakfast and a bit much to eat without having my coffee refilled. After putting it away, I finally got my first refill and downed that in a heartbeat. 

Overall, service was crap due to so many people and poor management. I felt bad for the waitress, but still begrudged my lack of coffee. Then for not having bacon, I am sorry. There is no excuse for an established early on Saturday morning to have run out of bacon. Together, this knocks off two stars. The food was food, but not worth the wait to get in, fight to get attention, and disappointment of maybe not having bacon. I'd consider coming back here, but only if it were not busy, which I am not sure happens.

Bacon.",1

I ordered a BBQ burger, with cheddar cheese, barbecue sauce, and fried onion straws. She got a burger with pepperjack, bacon, beer cheese fondue sauce, and chipotle mayo. We split a basket of fries and their mac and cheese.

Both burgers were cooked well, but mine being a little more basic, was fine. Hers, especially between the fondue cheese and the chipotle mayo, was fantastic. The fries were cooked and seasoned well, but the mac was out of this world. The preparation was basic, the cheese no more than a combination of american, cheddar, and velveeta, but damn. It was exactly what we were looking for. Next time we go I might just get their mac and cheese as my entree I enjoyed it that much.",1

It's almost difficult to choose which meat, salad bar item, or other item you want to eat first!  The candied bacon is worth the trip in an of itself!  AND they have valet parking!!

This place has history and was a big pull back when the Floridan was originally popular.  The restaurant still has the old time charm with it's dimly lit atmosphere and mini chandeliers.

4054580,4,"In general, I LOVE Aldi!  They are a ""cheaper"" end grocery store that still sells quality food and even organic, healthy food.  However, this particular Aldi needs updated. You can find most grocery items at Aldi.  They even sell non-grocery items such as household items, flowers and pet food.  The best items to buy for the value are eggs, milk and bread.  Everything there is good quality, even the meat (which I know some people are skeptical about).  Even though Aldi does not accept manufacturer coupons, you can sometime find a store coupon for $10 off $40.  

Two things to know if you're a first timer: 1) they do not bag your groceries.  You either have to buy your grocery bags from them (a few cents each) or bring your own bags.  And either way, you have to bag your own groceries at the countertop beyond the register.  2) You have to pay for/rent your grocery cart.  The grocery carts are all strung together outside the store.  You put a quarter into the slot on the top of the first grocery cart and it releases the chain that's locking it in.  Once you are finished with the grocery cart, you push your cart back into the stack of carts, place the chain from the other cart into your cart and it releases your quarter back to you.  (or if someone else is coming to get a cart, I usually just give them my cart in exchange for their quarter...win, win).",1

1188611,4,"This is Indeblue's second location, the original being in Collingswood, NJ.

The food is pretty on par with that location, except in terms of pricing: food is on average a dollar more per dish yet it is the same preparation and portions. A huge difference is that Philly served alcohol, while Collingswood is dry. Definitely love their Indian twists on cocktails here. The mango martini is tasty, like an alcoholic lassi without the creaminess. 

The food is not traditional Indian by any means, so don't come here expecting that. It's a cool contemporary approach to Indian cuisine that is no less delicious.

You can't go wrong with the chana masala, samosa, basmati rice, naan, or spinach chaat. I'm a vegan, and this restaurant is definitely accommodating and I have never had any trouble finding something to eat, especially with their knowledgable waitstaff (they even know what vegan means, you'd be surprised how many don't). 

It's usually a little too chilly inside for my taste, but it's not a big deal. It's pretty small inside and tends to get very busy around dinner time. I'd suggest making a reservation to be safe.

5952819,5,"There are always people in your life to whom giving a gift is way more stressful than it needs to be. When I first heard about Batch, I was like score; finally, an answer to my gift giving woes. 

Batch scourers the Nashville area for local, handmade, and artisan goods. They packages these goods together into bundles and will ship them anywhere you heart desires. Think gift baskets but way more awesome. Most of their items are related to food. When I ordered before Christmas, they had a number of packages. One was a breakfast package with pancake mix, coffee, and oatmeal. There was a night time rewind package complete with chocolate, tea mix, fancy lotion, and a candle. I went with the bourbon package ($35) which had a number of bourbon themed food: BBQ sauce, popcorn, candies, etc. At the time their packages ran from about $12 +, with a variety of different price points. They also sell some of their products individually. Their stock changes regularly (there are a bunch of different choices since I looked a month ago) so you can use this service again and again and again. In addition to one off gifts, you can give subscriptions where Batch delivers a themed box of Nashville products every couple months. 

In addition to being just an awesome service, Batch has some great customer service. I ordered two packages and soon after I placed my order, I got an e-mail from Batch. They wanted to know if my packages were Christmas gifts because the popcorn didn't have the longest shelf life and they didn't want it sitting under a tree for two weeks before consumption. If it was intended for Christmas, they were willing to hold my order until right before Christmas. That really goes above and beyond in my book. I mean, technically isn't it my fault if my recipients don't open their present until the end of the month? Not for Batch. Applause all around. 

The recipients of my gifts (my bosses) were really, really impressed. They complimented the packaging and the goods. One told me that he thought the package was from HIS boss because it was so nice. Being Yankees, they were a little confused about the BBQ sauce but I was happy to share some Southern culture. 

P.S.
Check out their website for information about the local people who produce the products they use. Reading the stories really reinforces what a great service this is. Not only do they provide an awesome service for consumers but they provide a sales opportunity for local small businesses.",1

I got the tri-tip sandwhich, and although it wasn't the BEST tri-tip sandwich I've ever had, it was still very good.  The food was reasonably priced as well.  This is one place I will definitely visit again.

The only somewhat negative thing about my experience was that it seemed like one of the staff members was pretty eager to get us in and get us out.  I didn't feel like we could leisurely finish our meal and leave at our own pace.  One of the ladies kept checking to see if we were done yet, and even took one of our plates before we were completely finished. Aside from that, it was an overall good experience.",1
5307419,4,"Just passing through town and thought we'd check this place out due to such positive reviews and we were not disappointed. Large portions of delicious food and very friendly wait staff. Next time I'm in Reno, I'll definitely eat here again.",1
4970513,3,"Eggs Benedict! Gotta love it! I am almost certain that I have ordered the eggs benedict every time I have visited. It is consistently good. Comes with hash browns and fruit. 

This location has a breakfast bar in the cafe and is a nice alternative to the wait that one often has to endure. The service can be super fast or super slow at the bar, but if you flag down a server, you get to order right away. Food always comes out rather quickly too. 

The wait staff is always friendly and will give you a to go cup for your beverage, if you ask for it. 

A pitcher with water and lemons is always brought to the table or available at the bar, so enjoy :)",1
5913854,3,"+ good location (right off of canal and decatur!) in a nice historic bldg. the rooms had a lot of character with odd room sizes, exposed brick, and windows of all different sizes. 
+ comfortable beds, bathrooms with breathing room. 

+/- free but slow wifi 
+/- breakfast was meh but free again. if you love waffles, you can make your own! 

- service was extremely SLOW! waited a long time to check-in. waited a long time to get our car, which is unacceptable for paying $30/night for. We called down 50 min in advance to get our car. I might come to stay again if a) I didn't drive and b) someone checked in for me an hr ahead of time.",1

78798,4,"The Vietnamese sandwiches here are sooooo good. So good in fact that my boyfriend and I haven't tried anything else on the menu because we can't pass up a barbecue pork Banh Mi sandwich!!!! The sandwiches are fresh tasting and perfect balance of meat and vegetables.  The prices are very reasonable .... If you get a 12"" sandwich they throw in a can of soda. The one bummer is that the restaurant shares space with Port O Subs... So it has a low end / fast food vibe.",1
4785870,4,"My first thought when I walked into Renee's was Damn this place smells good. The inside was a lot smaller than I expected but decorated very well. The seats were even comfortable! 
I started with the bruschetta and was satisfied with the three large pieces of mozzarella and tomato that came with it. The bread was warm and had good flavor, a little oily and I personally prefer my bruschetta with a crunch which this bread didn't have, but still good! I probably would try a different appetizer next time though. 
I split a pizza and got half vegan Thai curry and half bbq potato (great random toppings for a pizza). 
The Thai half was sweeter than I though, but it was coconut curry so I should've known. There were so many flavors with the Thai though that I could've eaten it all day. The vegan cheese wasn't over powering either so that was ideal. 
The bbq potato has a lottttt of cheese and not enough bbq sauce on the pizza itself. The potato on it was cooked perfectly and really added to it. 
Their cold brew is $4 for a small glass. That's a little much. In fact, all of their menu items are overpriced-reason for the dock in the rating.",1
6208854,5,"So, most of the time, if I wait too long to try a place that everybody raves about, it doesn't live up to my expectations...  But Pappy's DID!  I ordered the Frito Pie with brisket and it was DELICIOUS!!!  And even though they were hoppin', they were bringin' the BBQ out at an amaaaazing rate!  They really seem to have their system runnin' reeeeal smooth.  It was a nice surprise.  Would LOVE to get back here!!!",1
5362595,5,"Solid local neighborhood bar/restaurant in Fishtown.  A few friends and I came on a Sunday night dinner and sat on their large outdoor deck.  I only went inside briefly, but it looks pretty cool and very open - your average bar layout.

Our waitress was extremely nice and we came here knowing there were a lot of veggie options available.  They have a pretty good draft list that is constantly rotating.

We ordered a bunch of different food, such as the caesar salad, veggie wings, fried green tomato po boy, and the reuben with tempeh.  All of the food was fantastic, and in my opinion the reuben was the best sandwich.  The wings were interesting - there were pieces of fried brussel sprouts (not whole, just random pieces) hovering over veggie wings that were hiding underneath.  The wings itself were fine, standard, with buffalo sauce, but fried seitan with buffalo sauce is like crack for me.  The po boy was tasty, with this flaky, crusty bread that wasn't too chewy, and had a nice little tart to it.  The toasted rye bread for the reuben was on point and as mentioned, a delicious sandwich.  I'm picky with fries and these were really good - great flavor profile, a nice crisp to them.

Overall, a solid spot with delicious comfort food.  I'll definitely be back.",1

1129724,5,"Best Baja Mexican I've had since moving from California. Hands down. 

What I love: 

Portion size - I'm used to an overwhelming amount of food places before me in Indianapolis but I could comfortably finish my plate. 

Food - great balance of flavors. I ordered the grilled salmon tacos and loved that the tacos tasted just as good with or without the chipotle crema and lime. 

Ambience - modern design and upbeat music (not too loud).

I'll be back, time and time again!",1
2712484,5,"Gorgeous. Peaceful. Surprisingly peaceful to come in and do my Catholic duty even with the tourists walking around taking pictures. The museum downstairs is cute. Location is awesome for me. My only peeve is they put up the hours for confession yet there is never a priest to be found for confession lol. I'll let it slide but come on!!! Otherwise we're pretty much regulars for Mass so thats the rating its getting, its my church not an attraction for me.",1
2086043,4,Came in on Saturday night . The restaurant was busy and had an hour wait. We decided to sit by the bar. I ordered the sangria and my date got an old fashioned . Both were just ok. For dinner I Ordered the prime rib with Alfredo as a side . Entrees come with a choice of salad or soup . I got the Caesar salad which was yummy. My date got the lamb. Both entrees were delicious. For dessert we got cannolis and tiramisu. Eh I've had better . However the espresso martinis we ordered were amazing . Overall great food in an old school Italian setting .,1
722898,3,"My family visited Eddie's on a Thursday night, with an online deal in hand. I'd read over the menu and some Yelp reviews in advance, but tried to remain unbiased. So here's how it went:

As we walked up to the front door of the restaurant we were greeted with a cloud of smoke. They boast a large outdoor deck but this particular table was too close to the front door, and smoke blew right into faces. Not a very great welcome.

Were told to pick a seat, and after just a moment of sitting down, our waiter Sean(sp?) was quick to come introduce himself and give us our menus. We let him know it was our first time, and he gave us adequate space to make our decisions.


As far as our view, Eddie's has the typical sports bar theme with lots of t.v.s which I'm sure would be great for any sport enthusiast. What my son loved, though, was the attached mini arcade, complete with ski ball, claw machines, and a few other interactive games. Those were great for keeping us preoccupied while we waited for our food(which came out pretty quickly anyways).


I went with the Prime Rib Dip and a side of green beans. The sandwich comes with Black Angus prime rib and melted provolone cheese on a roll, but that's not all. On the side they give you a a cup full of au jus sauce. The dipper in me rejoiced at the volume.

So I take the first bite and BAM, flavor explosion. It was so good. I have no words to justify it. It was that good. I whooped down the first half of the sandwich and then made my way to the green beans. First bite and...what?! These otherwise perfectly good green beans were lukewarm and, dare I say, borderline cold. I came right off of my cloud. Being the good girl that I am, I ate them anyways and went right back to the second half of my sammy. There was my cloud again.  The au jus dip was so good my husband asked to have the remainder to dip his fries in. I obliged him.",1
561000,4,"Good Business hotel - Had everything I needed

My room was basic but had everything I needed, good sized bathroom, desk, lounge chair, closet, etc.  I always appreciate a bathrobe, which they provided.  I was on the 10th floor and got some road noise, so I would choose a high floor.  I use a white noise app to sleep anyway.  As a female traveler, I did miss a decent blow dryer, I've seen much better in lesser hotels, and eye make-up remover would have been nice, but they did have a jar of cotton, the standard small bottles of lotion, shampoo, etc.  
The gym was really nice, with two full walls of windows, and was never crowded during my stay.  Lots of cardio equipment and some weight machines. My only complaint was that, although they provide towels, they don't provide bottles of water.  They have a small water cooler with those cone shaped paper cups.
They have a real Starbucks (hooray), a nice bar area with great bartenders, a good casual sports bar and restaurant.
It's connected to the convention center via a sky walk, which was a perfect location for this visit.
There were multiple conventions coming in and out and they had a hard time keeping up with cleaning the rooms, which caused delays in getting to your room, but they provided bell service for your bag.",1

There was a line out front but I don't think we had to wait more than a couple of minutes to get in and get seated. The service was fast and friendly! Our food arrived quickly and the servers kept the drinks flowing! We were in a bit of a hurry because we wanted to catch an evening show on Bourbon Street. They had us in and out in plenty of time to make it to the show. The waiter, Rory, was training a new waitress, Jessica. Jessica was doing a great job, already noticing when customers want/need something, and taking the initiative to provide great service! I was going to order the Oysters Bienville but Rory suggested the Chargrilled Oysters, and I'm so glad he did! They were the best oysters I had the entire vacation! I'll definitely be back to Felix's again in the future!",1

Get a Hard Rock player card and save $5.00.  this buffet is worth going to as far as any buffets I have been to in the Tampa Bay area.

Best in Tucson, IMHO.",1

SNS polishes last three weeks or longer and gel typically lasts two or more weeks. I got gel when I went in Saturday and I felt completely safe. Masks were worn by all staff, there were partitions dividing each seat from the next as well as the manicurist and customer. They even have a system for paraffin wax treatments where customers are not dipping their hands in wax at all (they are scooping wax onto your hand to eliminate germ spread). They were friendly and welcoming as always!",1
2752946,4,"Really great vibe and our server, Rhyanna, was nice and on top of drink refills. Wasn't terribly thrilled with the blackened chicken pasta, but the food overall was good. We also had the pretzel app (mustard sauce is pretty spicy), my bf had the spicy chicken sandwich and loved it, and we finished off with bread pudding. Lots of food for leftovers too! Definitely recommend getting there around 5-6 to avoid the crowds.",1
2547363,3,"Very cool and comfortable diner atmosphere - white tiles and aged dark wood - in a historic district of New Orleans.

The hostess and the wait staff were very polite, young, and accommodating.

We both ordered coffee, and it was nice and strong and hot.  Many places in New Orleans have chicory coffee, which might be a little stronger than you're used to, so beware! 

Unfortunately, the food was just above average and didn't live up to the hype.  This might be due to our breakfast choices...

My wife ordered the Breakfast Seafood Platter (eggs benedict with fried seafood).  The eggs were fresh and good, but the seafood had been fried up earlier, and just reheated (i.e. - not cooked fresh to order).  This sounded amazing, but was not worth ~$20.

I ordered the Classic Stanley breakfast (scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and wheat toast).  I asked for other toast options, and took the English muffin (was charged an extra $1.50), and it was toasted perfectly.  It was the only thing cooked proper... the bacon and potatoes were barely warm and limp (not reheated properly on the griddle), and the eggs were runny enough that I couldn't finish. 

Perhaps it was an ""off"" day on our visit, but it was not crowded when we arrived on a Sunday morning at 8:15am.  New Orleans has such good food all over the city, so I would probably try somewhere else on our next visit.",1
165126,4,"On the morning of the 9th of December we had the opportunity to sail away on the Steamboat Natchez, one of only two operating steamboats in the world. After leaving the harbor which is really close to the French Quarter, we sailed east on the Mississippi River. The narrator on the speakers told stories about the boat and made historical remarks on the surroundings of New Orleans. I believe we went about half an hour southwest before turning around. The Natchez has plenty of space for seating on many different levels. On the lower level they offer food and I saw several traditional things to eat (I believe it's buffet style). On board they had a band performing live traditional music of New Orleans. The steamboat also has a souvenir shop. While sailing back and forth on the Mississippi River we had the opportunity to see several views of New Orleans, a battlefield from the 1800s and a sugar refinery.",1

Stopped in for a few drinks before dinner. Our table ordered Moscow Mules and Bloody Mary's, which were both equally delicious. They had a popcorn machine which worked out perfectly to snack on.

No one was monitoring wrist bands because my 5 year old was getting on the ultimate attractions (which he's too small for, mind you.) & at first I was stopping him, until I realized the kids running the place didn't care, so I let him.

6688425,5,"This is my favorite ""classic"" bakery in St. Louis. They serve simple bakery items with a twist to make them extra special. Serving scones with wild flavor combinations, cupcakes, seasonal cookie sandwiches, fluffy muffins, gooey brookies, giant cookies, fresh quiche, and more. If I lived closer this would be a monthly go to treat. 

I walked into the bakery with the mindset of wanting a muffin, latte, and my go to brookie. However, the smell of buttery, flaky pastry crust and cheesy egg filled the air. So, I had to grab a slice of warm quiche. There were two flavors available, I went with the spinach, Asiago, and chihuahua cheese. I did choose a muffin to eat the following day. I went with the cornmeal cranberry. As I ate it this morning, I was pleasantly surprised when I felt a pop in my mouth from fresh, not dried, whole cranberries. The muffin was still moist the next day. Then there was the brookie. I have to grab at least one every time I come in. They are gooey, fudgy, crunchy on top, and chocolate decadence. The raw sugar topping is an extra special touch to the rich center of explosive flavor. 

The coffee and espresso served is from the local St. Louis roaster Kaldi's. I ordered a latte which is generally made with whole milk and added peppermint syrup. All of the syrups are house made and there are several options from vanilla and chocolate to caramel and honey spice. I went with the seasonal flavor that was not listed. 

A few years ago I was surprised with a cake from here for my birthday. It was a chocolate cake with caramel filling. As it was pricey, it was also my all time favorite layered cake I have ever had. 

I would recommend pint size to the every day bakery goer, visiting family, a traveling tourist, in need of a cake, to cater an event, and everything else in between!",1

And there is ample parking behind the building... in case you're not finding any out front. 
There are some favorite menu items but also those that you can not always find on the typical Mexican menu. So that's a big plus. And the brunch items are not that easy to find around town. 
I enjoyed having chicarrones for starters instead of the usual chips and salsa. Big plus for that. 
I had the breakfast torta with potatoes on the side. Btw, those breakfast potatoes are delicious. There are other veggies in there, like a hash of some sorts and then pan fried I believe. Either way I totally recommend those. My huge torta was also quite yummy, lots of meaty goodness. 
The portions were hearty and the prices reasonable. Could you eat cheaper? Yes, but would you get this quality of food? Probably not.

18900,5,I've been here twice in the past two weeks and both times the experiences were great.  The first time was a dinner party for a friend.  We had a big group of people and all had dinner downstairs.  The service was EXCELLENT.  Sometimes with big parties it is hard to get good service but I had no complaints what so ever.  Appetizers were served to the whole table and they were delicious.  We had the risotto balls and the spinach/cheese stick things and I can't remember the third.  I had the wedge salad and also the filet.  Both were delicious.  I came back a second time for their happy hour and was pleased as well.  The appetizers were cheap and so were the drinks and that's a great combo! I live a few blocks away so I plan to come here a lot more!,1

966995,3,"I would suggest against Pizzeria Stella as a first, second, third, or fourth date option IF you're getting pizza.  The crust will leave your teeth filled with crunchy black bits from the wood fired oven. BUT, if you're going to get something from here, you want to get the gelato. $4 for enough for two-three people.  The olive oil or honey mascarpone are freakishly delicious and light.  

The pizza is fine, though a little too wet and mushy.  The beers are priced typically for this part of the city, but the cocktails can be pretty nice (read: have a pompelmo).

I won't be back anytime soon for pizza, but I might have to go back for the gelato.",1

A ghost pepper pickle?! Cmon man! How could that be so good??!! Loved it and I will be back!",1

I started at RAC (Heather's Cardio Kickboxing) in September of 2014, and since then have seen INCREDIBLE results. I came in with some, but limited knowledge about working out and kickboxing. From the get-go, I was welcomed with open arms, and had great instruction and demonstration. The classes are different everyday to prevent plateauing, and range from body weight exercises, mitts and glove work, cardio, weights, etc. I am currently also enrolled in Strength and Conditioning, and have tried the bootcamp, self defense, firearms training and CCW Certification as well. When I started, I was 250 lbs at my heaviest, I have lost roughly 55lbs and about 80 inches overall, and still steadily losing. I am also enrolled in Heather's Nutritional One-on-One Consult, which has taken my results to the next level. This place truly feels like a family oriented environment, and is amazing for all fitness levels. You get what you pay for, and this place has it all. They are so caring and truly want to see everybody succeed. Come get trained by the best!",1

There was enough meat and cheese in there to feed Germany for a year. I give the place 5 stars because the taste was better than any other cheesesteak I've had in Philly. Perfect balance of melt and moist (service was friendly and place was clean, too). I also tried the pizza fries, which I liked. Finally, the only negative I can say was that the music didn't sound right. It was like some Kygo trance vegan music.",1

The only complaint I have is that when I order veggie things I sometimes, most of the time, get pieces of meat in my food items. So this morning I found bacon. It's not really a big deal but it's kind of annoying to have to go through and pick it out every time to make sure I'm not gonna eat something that's gonna make me sick.",1
2129581,5,A few years ago I decided to look for a new dentist. I have had a number of dentists over my 66 years. I researched locally and out of the area for some extensive dental work. I decided on an appointment with Dr. Pastrell. They took care of all my needs in-house. I have constantly been amazed by the care and concern for my well being both physically and financially by Dr. Pastrell and his office team.,1

4417116,5,"We were visiting Nashville and Hattie Bs came up at the top of the list of restaurants so we gave it a try. Our hotel was a 3 minute walk so we headed over aeound 7:00 on a Wednesday evening.  It wasn't hard to miss as we walked up the sidewalk and saw the line.  About 25 people outside.  Had to wait about 45 minutes and it was well worth it.  I got the Damn Hot wings.  I like hot stuff and these were hot.  Whatever the spice is, it gets under the tongue and lingers.  E wings and 2 sides filled me up.  Only downside was some rednecks whonwere upset that they ran out of wings.  They stood in the corner cussing with many kids around.  
    I would definitely go again and hopefully the rednecks don't come back.",1

It started rough - we got caught in a torrent of rain - but Jean Paul was up to the challenge. Not only did he know the history of every drink we imbibed in and location we visited, not only was he up-to-speed on the best watering holes to hit for locals and tourists alike, not only was he able to deftly able to manage our eclectic group, he managed to turn the tour into one of the best experiences of the weekend.

I doubt, though, that Jean Paul is his real name. I mean, c'mon.",1
6770757,5,This place is excellent! I ordered the full slab of ribs and it was some of the best ribs I've ever had. And I've had a lot. They had the best Smokey flavor and just the right amount of tenderness . They were very meaty! The prices were reasonable too and the staff was nice. I went through the drive through . The BBQ sauce was really good also!,1
2753662,3,"The dilemma of how to review a bad experience at one of my favorite restaurants raises the issue of which is more important... food quality or service? I decided my 1 to 5 star review policy for restaurants should weigh 3 of those stars for food and the remaining 2 for service. As such, I'm giving 3 stars for the consistency and excellent quality of all the menu items here. Had the Prime meatloaf last night, which was flavorful and appropriately spiced. But then there was the service. Upon arriving on a Thursday at 6pm, the place was packed. No OpenTable affiliation so I couldn't reserve from that app in advance. Was told there would be a 30-minute wait for my party of 3. After the wait, the host then asked us to follow her and proceeded to seat us, WITHOUT ASKING, at a table OUTSIDE in 87-degree heat and swarming mosquitoes. I was wearing a heavy hoodie because I get a little cold in decent air conditioning, which I prefer based on previous visits. Wasn't even aware they had outside seating. The hostess left us so fast I didn't even have time to ask for an inside table. Told a runner who took our drink orders it was too hot but she never came back. The server finally showed up after 15 more minutes and I told her it was too hot, and by then I was sweating and showing signs of medical dehydration. I found it difficult to breathe. She said she could move us but wanted to go check WITHOUT taking our order, which would mean we would sit there even longer in the heat without an order in progress. I insisted we order first, which she didn't seem to know how to handle since we'd probably be changing servers. Not exactly rocket science. But after we ordered, a change was never made. Bread was delivered to the table without plates or knives. Plates came 5 minutes later but no knives for the butter. Knives came after another 5 minutes. We gave up on the table change. Now I was about to pass out and had to remove my hoodie which meant I was now underdressed in a white t-shirt. Mosquitoes were diving and bombing all over me. Diet Coke came and it was flat, with a low CO mix. Food came and as I mentioned, was top notch and clearly prepared by an experienced and talented chef... In air conditioning, I would assume. After that, I was ready to be airlifted out of there on a stretcher and wanted the check to pay and get back into my air conditioned vehicle. Gave the server my credit card and SHE DISAPPEARED WITH IT FOR 30 MINUTES and NEVER CAME BACK. When I finally flagged her down, I told her I needed my credit card back and she realized she had never processed it. This was the final nail in my coffin. My body is buried out behind the restaurant and this is the epitaph on my tombstone.",1

2669300,5,"Easily one of my favorite places to grocery shop in Philadelphia! Produce selection is huge. They always have fantastic deals, even with organic stuff. There are a ton of healthy options that you won't find in your usual grocery store, and they also have an extensive frozen section. A lot of things like rice, beans, nuts, trail mix, chocolate covered goodies, etc are sold by the pound, which I love - with covid, they are pre-bagging these self service items, but they typically have multiple sized bags ready to go.

I've gotten some awesome deals on wild fish and high quality meat (I'm talking cheaper than grocery store sales), and I've even gotten some decent sushi rolls here - there's one day a week where every roll is $5! They also have boar's head cold cuts which I can't always find at grocery stores in Philly for some reason.

I've never had to wait in line a crazy amount of time, which is pretty surprising based on how popular they seem to be. One hour non-metered street parking is usually easy to find, but they apparently have a validated parking garage I have yet to check out.",1
5772770,4,"This would def be 5 stars if the place weren't so freaking noisy ( and only half full). On vacay and so excited to be able to get brunch items on a weekday. Hubs swears best grapefruit juice ever and he loved his smoked salmon crepe with creme fraiche and capers. Maybe a tad stingy with the lox for the price, but tasty and healthy. It was hard for us both to choose and at the last minute I switched to the bahn-mi with greens for my side. Sandwich was tasty and good although again a bit stingy on the chicken. Honestly, the generous portion of greens dressed in the best vinaigrette EVER made me very happy. Service was adequate and setting was non-description, but food shone.",1

Emily invited us to try on optical and sun products and even suggested certain styles that would suit our needs. Emily and the rest of the associates that were in the store that day were simply amazing. This is one of the most memorable customer service experiences I've ever received, which is why I ultimately wanted to pick out a pair for myself and my friend. I would recommend anyone who is in the town that stop by and try on some pairs.",1

Sliders: Would NOT order again. Nothing special about them except how over priced they are for the quality of them. 
Coconut Shrimp: Not a big coconut fan but the sweet chili sauce won me over. 
Chicken & Waffles: Good but don't order if you're expecting anything other than soggy waffles. The other reviews don't lie. 
Onion Tower: Not bad. They're just onion rings stacked on top of each other.

Overall the experience was not bad except that I was confused as to who my server was and once they took my order I never saw them again. Found a dirty knife in our rollup but they apologized and replaced it.

4455104,4,"So after living in St. Louis for four years, I finally make it to the Earth Day Festival which is always on the MUNY grounds in Forest Park. And it was totally worth it. 

The St. Louis Earth Day Festival is definitely comprehensive. Do you want to recycle stuff? Yep, you can do that at the community college - Forest Park campus and then take the trolley over to help the environment. Do you want to learn how to green your house or source local materials or make your garden more native-friendly? Yep, you can do all of that. Do you want to act like a five year old? Yep, you can color and plant stuff like your children are clambering to do --- I know firsthand, they'll LET you. Do you want to start collecting reusable bags like you used to collect baseball cards? Yep, in all different colors (hint: apparently the MUNY and YELP bags are the new Hank Aaron and Nolan Ryan). Yoga? Check. CSAs? Check. Electric cars? Check. Fold-it-yourself Metrolink piggy banks? Check. Short films, performances, and lots of different food? Check, check, check.

Even the website is super comprehensive. The only thing that the website doesn't have is a scanned pdf of the festival map, which would have been a big help. It did have a scanned pdf/link to Google Maps regarding parking and closed roads (which was pretty awesome). But sometimes, you like to look at the festival map to see where you'd want to start beforehand. Regardless, I had expected through all the news and media that parking was going to be a huge hassle, but honestly, it really wasn't. By the time I got there, a few hours into the event, there were still open spots on the upper deck of the MUNY parking lot. Either there was a lot of parking to go around or people are hard-core! They probably windsailed it over to MUNY...when I can barely make it up the hill from the front entrance to the upper deck. And all the media outlets had said to skip the Hampton exit because of the zoo traffic...well, that traffic was pretty nonexistent too. Who knows? Whatever it is...keep on doing it, people. I unfortunately will have to be killing the environment, one smog particle at a time.

I then met up with the extremely hilarious Mandie M., and we got our socks knocked off for the rest of the afternoon. There was so much to do and so much to see! She did some networking and coloring; I did some planting and scheming. Before we knew it, we had seen all of the booths. It was a bit confusing because the festival map alludes to a much bigger area than it really is...plus some of the attractions aren't labelled well. The volunteers knew their stuff though...major props to them. 

We then decided to take in some of the performances. There was a youth dance troupe, which was extremely enthusiastic, and a youth string orchestra, which played complicated pieces for their ages. Then...the highlight came in the form of the Shakespeare Festival St. Louis Education Tour, which gave us a synopsis of Othello, which is being performed this summer. It was supposed to last 30 minutes, but it actually was an hour...and it pretty much was the entire story...beautifully acted. The best part was that we had front row seats to this amazing performance. 

I can't wait until next year...now that I know what it's like, I definitely want to go back! There's something for everyone...diversity with an environmental theme!",1
4244252,5,"While visiting Philly for the day, my fiance and I took a detour that led us right to Cookie Confidential. 
It wasn't the sign. 
It wasn't the aroma. 
It was the display case of Mason Jars filled with cookies. 
My fiance walked in and wanted to buy the actual jars... but when we were denied the jars (sad face) we settled for a dozen cookies to devour on our bus ride home to NYC. 
The store was EMPTY on a friday afternoon. We hope because everyone was on vacation or something. This is a great space with great cookies. 
We took home the ginger snaps which were my favorite, the oatmeal pecan, chocolate chip and Torreos. 
The cookies were fresh and soft the way cookies ought to be... but the one I'm writing home about is the ginger snap. 
(for the record, the Torreo - the owner's twist on oreo's- was remniscent of a whoppie pie. not bad but definitely not an oreo) 
I think adding a milk bar would be ideal. Imagine jonesing for a cookie and running to CC, grabbing your favorite cookie and ordering a glass of almond (soy, or cow) milk, plopping down on a comfy chair and having a few moments of bliss?? 

Please pay this adorable cookie shop a visit.",1

(He is 6). Each station has its own TV and they will put on any requested show (I guess within reason). The salon was clean and the people were friendly. They were even having $10 haircuts for July! 

More importantly than all of this- my son came away with a great haircut! Finally rid of the mom's covid special! He usually gets annoyed with being ""itchy"", but said this time ""I'm not even itchy"". We are happy customers and will definitely be returning!",1

MEATLOAF!!!!! Try the meatloaf. I know this sounds crazy but OMG I think this meatloaf was personally prepared by the food gods. I am not a big fan of meatloaf because it's just a giant chunk of meat...gross. The shaved duck has changed my mind it was savory but sweet. It was not greasy or dense. It was a piece of perfection. Also tri tips and burnt ends were on point.

3867243,3,"You know everybody raves that this place is so good... But most of the people that I know that rave about it, come here for breakfast. Maybe I'll have to give that a go someday. My experience here was for lunch. I had a spinach salad for lunch here, and it just was blasé. It came dry with no dressing. The waiter informed me that he forgot and had to go whip me up some in the kitchen. My partner does come here all the time (at breakfast though)for meetings with her friends and says it is fabulous. I just got my salad was nothing extraordinary or out of the park. 

I had a spinach pear salad and it was not dressed, and had half a pair on it with a nut in the middle. That's it. All ingredients weren't totally chopped up and prepared in a cohesive manner and no dressing -- Which I had a request because they forgot it - - had absolutely no herbaceous flavor. It came with a dry cut up chicken breast. It was fresh enough, just blasé. My partner had a southwest salad and hers was also dry and uneventful.

476999,3,"Food - ehh...    Dessert... YUM!

I wanted to love this place more much more than I did.  It is modern, clean, and boasts healthier options, which is important to me when I eat out.  I eat basically a paleo diet, so I ordered the double down with garlic sauce.  The food was ok, but not great - not a lot of flavor to be honest.  Also, the portion was very small - I was still hungry afterward.  The meals run about $10 without any add-ons or sides, which is fine for organic veggies and meat, but it just wasn't anything I would go back for. 

 The best part by far was the banana whip dessert!  If I had only eaten that, I would have rated it at least 4.  And it was HUGE.  You can order it plain, which is basically just frozen, whipped bananas, or you can get it with cocoa powder and peanut butter.  You can also choose toppings like you would for ice cream.  For a healthier alternative to ice cream, I would go back for just dessert there, although I would plan to split it with someone!",1

1528788,5,"Had to finally sign up for Yelp to review this wonderful restaurant.

My husband and I went to Zahav this past Saturday evening for a belated birthday dinner. We made the reservation back in April and 6/21 was the first Saturday with a reasonable time available - so I was praying that it would be worth the wait. It was!

We were coming from Media, and Zahav is really easy to get to from 95. We used the valet at the Sheraton across the street, which I believe has a discount for diners at Zahav. Very easy & a relief to not have to worry about parking or find a garage a mile away. 

The exterior of the restaurant looks like an office building, but the inside is stunning. The large window looking out toward Old City is a great view to have while enjoying a fantastic meal.  

We were planning on doing the typical tasting menu, but were told the Chef's tasting with the lamb shoulder was available, so we jumped on the opportunity to try their signature dish. 

We started with cocktails - the marble rye was delicious and clever. We were served the selection of salatim with hummus and bread. They were very generous portions for two people. I loved the eggplant and beet salads, and hubby loved the spicy carrots. The traditional hummus was also killer. 

The mezze with the Chef's tasting included the fried grape leaves, fried cauliflower, chicken kebabs, and smoked sable. Everything was delicious, different and presented beautifully. However, I wished we could have chosen our own mezze since we are pretty adventurous eaters, and the picks seemed like the safer choices off the menu. 

Anyway - we were stuffed at this point, and then the lamb came out. Holy cow! I don't know what I was expecting, but it was a huge, huge portion of the most ridiculous, perfect lamb I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. It came with a side of Persian wedding rice, which we both enjoyed and loved how the crispiness played off of the tender lamb. 

We were served two desserts, which were brought out automatically, and were not able to choose. Both were yummy and basically licked the plates clean, but like the mezze, I wish we could have picked our own. I guess we'll just have to go back again! 

I also need to mention the staff. Both my husband and I could not believe how polite every employee was while we were there. The service was flawless and management should be proud of their staff. We agreed that Zahav might have the nicest employees of any restaurant we've ever been to. Amazing. We'll definitely return!",1
6771073,5,"Update: came back here and had the pork steak. Their pork steak game is so strong it's ridiculous. Will definitely be returning to this place over and over.

4310036,5,The best sandwich shop in the area! I've been here for two days and eaten here twice! Told all of my family members about it too. I had the Thanksgiving sandwich both times.

1593179,4,"I am positive that at some moment in life every human being craves greasy, glorious fried chicken! This is the place you go to when you need to hit that spot! When I come here, I get the five piece wings and a side. I try and switch it up on the sides, but the red beans are my favorite. 

The chicken pieces are huge, hot, and crispy. The chicken is just the right amount of crispy on the outside, and inside it's still moist and delicious! ( I hate dried out chicken) It's damn near impossible to not start in on the chicken right there in the parking lot! This past time I devoured my chicken so quickly that I forgot there was even red beans awaiting my attention! By time I was done, I was covered in crumbs and grease stains all over my desk at work! Did I mention the chicken wings are ginormous? When I finished them I was full, but still behaved greedily and devoured my red beans!

This isn't a go in, sit down, and order place; which is fine by me. They are quick, and you'll never wait long. Also, the prices are very inexpensive. Enjoy.",1
1452890,4,Stopped in here last night for a quick dinner before hitting Bourbon St. The chicken and andouille gumbo and blackened catfish hit the spot. The server was very attentive and the place had a nice vibe. Def worthwhile.,1
6644888,5,The store itself is a amazing testament to a bygone era in retail when they were downtown and easily assessible to all...but what really rocks are the amazing people who always wait on me on the second floor.......they make me feel really good and are always so professional.  I believe that is why i keep coming back.....Hmmm...should I mention names probably not but there are some outstanding people working in the shoe department & also in the men  clothing area....My only disappointment gripe----no electronics department in 2008.....,1
2499621,4,"It's hard to believe that I haven't written a review for Duchess. This is a world famous bakery that has gotten some serious recognition; remember when they were featured on a Buzzfeed article? 

I've been coming to Duchess for a number of years but I must admit, I don't come often. The main reason is that it's always insanely busy here. Expect to wait in line, good luck finding a table, and get there early for the best selection of baked goods. Despite this, I usually make a stop here in the fall (mid-September to mid-October) to pick up their seasonal Apple Earl Grey Jelly. This instead of PSL is my fall treat. It's so comforting with an Earl grey tea or London Fog. 

Whenever I'm at Duchess I must have their Lunch Combination. For some reason their lunch is super underrated but I think that Duchess makes the best quiche in the city. It's only $12 for their lunch combination - you can get a slice of Vegitarian or Meat  Quiche (they have other sandwich options available too), a side salad and a seasonal soup. It's a fantastic deal for quality food. If I could eat this everyday for lunch I would. 

I would come to Duchess more often but it's just so much of a hassle. There's so much room in the cafe for more chairs and tables, I don't know why they don't take advantage of it. It's so awkward trying to enjoy the food and company when you have people starring at you so they can be first to grab your seat. 

Despite this, Duchess really does have delicious and good quality food. It's the closest we can get to France here in Edmonton. I urge you to go if you haven't been here already!",1
5698476,4,"Free zoo! Free zoo! Free zoo!

I don't even like zoos usually, but this one sways me with its vastness, penguins( despite being stinky) and little zoo train (you're so close to the lions you could almost fall in and be eaten alive! woohoo!). Plus it's free, did I mention that? Ah free. 

Oh and I forgot a few other things that I very much enjoyed:
Herpetarium - liiiiiizards up close, well in little plastic boxes
Bugs
Darwin - he's near the entrance and is creepy as hell, but kinda reminds me of grandpa...

The only thing I did not like about the zoo was that rust colored sculpture that sits in front of the entrance to the park. The one made up of rusty elephants and giraffes and lions etc. Bleh what a piece of crap. Don't touch it, you might need a tetanus shot. How much did the city waste on that?",1
1205913,5,"Unique donuts and a fair selection. Wish they had more choices but I think once they sell out, that's it for the day (at least). Also the lattes are superb. Cozy atmosphere as well. Next time, I plan on trying their donuts burger is hot dog!",1
6068615,5,"After faithfully going to Bangkok Cuisine for the last 15 years I decided to give Thai Lotus a try. All these awesome photos on Yelp from my fellow Yelpers looked amazing and awfully convincing. 

We went there on a rainy day and the place was still very busy, that's always a good sign. Good food always has a full house. That rain put me in the mood for a hot curry. Their menu is so extensive! It's hard to settle on a couple of dishes with so many delicious options. 

We had the chicken Thai Lotus Salad with peanut dressing; peanut dressing makes this salad, next time I'll try the sesame dressing. Salad is very fresh tasting. Loved it! Also had their Thai Street Noodle Chef Special; omg this was amazing! Nothing out there like I've ever tasted, you seriously have to give this dish a try. This dish has some sort of beef stewed meat in it and is absolutely delicious. I would keep the slices jalapeños out of this dish, they just didn't taste good to me with the rest of the seasonings.        

Had to order the Pumpkin Curry with beef at a 2 star because my guest doesn't do anything spicier but my server lady was sweet enough to get me fresh Thai pepper sauce on the side. My first pumpkin curry and my tastebuds fell in love with it too. I can have this dish everyday and I'd be a happy camper. One question though; why do they give you a plate for your curry at every restaurant out there that serves curry? I always ask for a little bowl. I fill it with rice and add all that curry goodness on top and scoop it out. Only way to do the curry thing right. 

Next on the list was Pork basil fried rice. I always order this out of habit. I love fried rice. Thai Lotus makes a tasty one with all sorts of veggies. It's very colorful and tasty. 

Even though I was pretty full from this huge meal I still had room for the sticky rice and mango. Perfectly sweet and salty. I love this dessert! 

I was happy with my dinner experience. I'll visit them again and try some other new dishes. Everything on the menu looks interesting. I have my eye on that beef salad!",1
960456,4,"Nice little brunch spot. Good coffee, and timely service. The omelets are great here so do yourself a favor and order one of those.

They get very busy in a matter of minutes, so you might want to get here early. The staff here hustles though, so don't get offended when they drop off the check 10 minutes after you start eating.",1
6780739,4,"I decided to give Boba Tea a try! I was able to taste some of the tea before purchasing (they have tea on tap). I went with the Levander Tea with Boba. It was really good, if you don't like the taste of Levander then this is not the tea for you (it have an other taste). Also, they were not stingy with the amount of Boba they put in the Tea. 

Not only are the Tea's great the atmosphere of the shop is so cool! It remains me of vintage bookstore. You are instantly calm when you walk in. They have spots where you can do your homework, play games or just lounge on the sofa. If you're looking for Boba Tea and a cool atmosphere then this is the place to visit.",1
768469,4,"Incredibly solid Indian food...good portions, reasonable prices. Doesn't offer much in the way of ambiance, but I don't mind. Wouldn't be my idea of the perfect date spot, but you won't be disappointed with the food. Two entrees could feed four people. They also have a closed off dining room for patrons who wish to eat in--and it has ac!! I will return.",1

2380018,5,Probably the best veggie burger around. The staff is always helpful. The main reason we go is for the food and because of their employee DeAndre. This man has character and adds a great value to this business. He checks on every customer and you can tell he truly loves his job. The fries are good too. But we mainly go for the veggie burgers and DeAndre!,1

5830435,5,"After so many so so Chinese meals, this was a real treat. We stumbled into it accidentally, and it was to our very good fortune. The vegetable steamed dumplings were delicate little packages scented with ginger and basil. The hot and sour soup was made to order and contained fresh white ribbons of tender tofu in a tangy and spicy broth. This is what Chinese food is when it is done properly.",1
5585185,5,"A great and professional salon! The gals here are very friendly and inviting, and the environment is very clean and cute. It's a lovely establishment nestled near the downtown scene. Oh, and they have a parking lot behind the business! 

I am definitely a novice at the whole taking-care-of-your-hair thing seeing that I only cut my hair, like, twice a year (yikes, I know), but my stylist took great care of my hair here (after we joked about how badly I take care of it). I went in to see Andrea for my first time here. I wanted to get a pretty dramatic cut to a bob, and she knew exactly how to implement the task! She is also super personable, and I felt comfortable just having a conversation with her. I learned a lot about her professional backstory and was able to come to the conclusion that she is very experienced, and I felt immediately lucky that she was doing my hair. 

I will definitely be coming back here as I can confidently say that I have found ""the place"" to get my hair done! Highly recommend this business!",1

Highly recommended.",1
44333,5,"My boyfriend and I sat at the bar tonight. The staff at the bar was more than helpful with the questions we had about the tequilas and the different specials. We also ordered food while there. We're both vegan, so we had a few extra questions to ask regarding ingredients. The staff member taking our order was super helpful with addressing our questions. When he wasn't completely sure, the manager on duty and the chef came over. That's beyond great service! We honestly don't try to be needy or ask annoying questions and the staff made us feel like it was no big deal. We definitely will be back and will for sure be checking out that tequila flight! Thanks guys!",1

4266445,3,"The oyster po'boy was excellent, and the mac n' cheese was probably the best I've had from the type of restaurant this is. The woman behind the counter allowed me the side substitution without a blink of an eye or an extra charge. 

The prices were up there compared to other places I've been, but a six-inch sandwich with a side is well worth the price tag. 

However, my friend got really sick after eating, and the shrimp po'boy he had was really the only thing that we could pin it down to, besides the ever elusive 24-hour flu (which I've read is usually really food poisoning).

I'm still giving this three stars, since we can't be certain that it was the shrimp he had, and I liked my food so much.",1
4120925,3,"See them around and wanted to try one. Ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon. Chicken was pretty funky, poor quality, bit into weird hard chunks several times. Bacon also just not good quality. Sandwich dripping with grease. Overall really bad. Comes with potato chips. They give a good amount and they're not bad, though they void go a little easier on the salt. Luckily I noticed on the menu it said it came with bleu cheese dressing all over everything so I asked for it on the side. I'm not especially a bleu cheese fan so can't really give an opinion on that. Waitress was very nice, and the menu selection seemed good, but judging from that sandwich, I would not rush back.",1

It was a cute space inside and right next to I-Tap. I'd like to come back to try the pizza for real, not just a 'taste' although that taste was pretty good.",1
6265127,4,"Fast and friendly service. The food was solid, especially the buffalo cauliflower bites. Not many vegan restaurants in the area so this place definitely serves a need. The one downside is the price. It's a bit high for my liking, but if you enjoy eating vegan this place is worth a try.",1
6338951,5,Simply the best Cuban sandwiches on the planet and I've even had them in Cuba. Get the King Cuban and get ready for the experience.

For the adults, we absolutely loved the slides and the wave pool. There is even an area of water only 6 inches deep where you can just lay down and tan yet still be cool.

114153,5,"Work brought me into this struggling neighbor, which is 50% nice, 50% suspect. But within a 3-block area lies a handful of great restaurants and bars. This is the best of these places for a nice beer or glass of wine.

The bartenders here are excellent. Within a few minutes of questions and conversation about my history with craft beers, I was getting small 1 oz. tasters of all sorts of beers, comparing my favorites to his favorites to find the best pint imaginable. While some businessmen may see this as unorthodox, I still ended up with 4 pints that night, and a revisit twice more in the same week. 

There is a ton of seating, mixed between the outdoors area with heat lamps nearby, or some of the tables inside, primarily made of simple wood designs. 

I haven't tried any food or coffee yet, but the fact that I can get an espresso and a west-coast IPA in the same sitting is pretty incredible. They host a handful of events, including film screenings. I hope to get there for one of those.

I can't recommend a specific beer since they have so many amazing bottles as well as a rotating selection of drafts. Always ask the bartender. If you go now, get the Quadrupel (it's a whopping 11.6% and worth every bit of the $6).

If I had the money, liver, and time I would be here every single night.",1

There's a good selection of everything from home decor, beauty, clothing, toys, etc. They've got a few designer items too at fair prices; Even their clearance section has decent finds and doesn't feel like it's been picked through. Some areas were a little haphazard in organisation though and the selection for infants/children were minimal compared to other locations. I like its overall layout & the fact that the location is in the brewery district, so it feels almost like you are hitting up a variety store while out to eat or grocery shopping, but parking can be slim at times too since the parking lot caters to many other businesses. It wasn't very busy on a weekday evening which is a plus and the cashier was pretty efficient despite being the only one at the till.",1

It is so flavorful and juicy and crunchy. Because of other reviews, I went with mild because I was scared the others would be too hot.

3437914,3,I want to love this place but I can't. Maybe it's because the Link group acquired it but there is an infuriating rigidity. If you order a sandwich and they don't have the bread it is supposed to be on they WILL NOT substitute a different bread. Today I ordered a sandwich that is supposed to be on a baguette. There were baguettes sitting on the shelf but they are day old and they're not allowed to use them. Even though I said it was ok. Still when you get what you want it's pretty pretty good.,1

658774,3,We visited SET in the Northern Liberties area of  Philadelphia called SET NOLibs. We order a bunch of appetizers to try. Most of the appetizers were ok and needed work to get it to the taste they need to be. Our favorites were the Jalapeño cheeseburger spring rolls and the tempura shrimp poppers. The charbroiled oysters were dry and burnt ( they need to pay special attention to details). We ordered loaded tots and the waitress did not tell us they didn't have tots and brought us French fries that we sent back and they did not charge us. The mojito did not taste like one and was very strong and bitter( must pay attention to recipe) don't make drinks too strong. Their sliders were also ok. Bahn mi buttered steak sliders needed more flavor and the meat more caramelization flavor to it. Sesame chicken sliders were not at all sesame chicken. Their batter needs work to make it more tasty.  No sesame flavor and could use some sweet and sour sauce to it for added flavor. One of our favorites were the soy glazed pork belly Skewer which was tasty but the Vietnamese buttered steak cubes and lemongrass chicken were not the taste of Vietnam. I would suggest to go to a Vietnamese restaurant and learn the spices of Vietnam and redo these dishes to taste like Vietnamese cuisine. The atmosphere was nice with heaters to keep us warm outside which was an added touch. The service was acceptable but hoped for better service because not a lot of people there. We had to ask for water and it took a while to get it. Also we made reservations at 3pm and our food didn't come until 4:10. Be prepared to wait some time. You can't be in a hurry to eat here.

The enchilada sauce was somewhat spicy but very good. The most recent time we were there I had the pleasure of meeting the owner.

I probably come here once a month to eat and while it's disappointing that their small menu rarely changes, it works because the few items they do offer are done right.

Sometimes during the Summer months the place can be quite busy in the morning and 4 or 5 extra tables outside with a view of the Mountains to the South and West would be great.

684443,3,"Was excited a coffee shop opened close enough for me to walk to. But let's be real: this place is overpriced hipster garbage. My chicory cold brew was flavorless, even with the added vanilla. The avocado toast is $6! a slice...you know toast is just bread right? 

We complain that people are underpaid and there's a wealth gap: maybe have $3 iced coffees and affordable breakfast choices. Don't add to the problem.",1
3001240,3,"Good but not great. District chicken and some desserts were the highlight. 

No complaints on our margaritas. 
Our waitress and other staff also did a nice job. 

Food: 
Traditional guacamole - very good, but the presentation and weird bowls almost made it look dirty...they should take one from the book at El Vez, if I ate only with my eyes it would not have been touched
Ceviche- sub-par but they didn't skimp on the shrimp
Chilango chop salad- good but underwhelming
Los hongos- good but there is an art to using truffle oil, more doesn't necessarily mean better
District chicken- excellent, cooked perfectly and flavorful, 

Dessert:
Tres leches- expected great but only got good, on the other hand, the flan and panna cotta were excellent! 

Glad I went, but don't think I would go back.",1
1872138,5,"The ambiance of this place is amazing, from the different quotes in the wall to the different center pieces on the table. The food was amazing and you can tell it's very homemade. The ketchup was amazing and the pickle was awesome. The waiter was very friendly and helpful and letting us know what special burger was for the day. I will coming back again.",1

3278327,3,"Unfortunately this franchise as a whole appears to be slowly slipping.

I haven't been to a Ted's in quite some time.  But I remember the burgers being a little bit better the last time I was there. Perhaps in this time of pandemic the supply chain has been interrupted or otherwise affected.

The service at this particular restaurant was certainly friendly, and the server did make a point of checking on us from time to time.

In the end however it does all come down to the food, and the food was better on prior visits.  It wasn't bad this time, just not as good as it used to be.",1
6057252,5,New Studio! Which means it's super easy to get into classes- if you've been curious about OTF this is the perfect studio to check it out. If you're a veteran you'll love the extra space and no waitlists. I predict by the summer this place will be packed.,1
6899951,5,"I accidentally found this place trying to get to Hook & Press next door & I am so glad I did! We were on our way out of SB and I took a dozen empanadas ($45) to go. I chose half chicken and half Gaucho (shredded beef). 

That same day I ate one hours later cold and it was delicious with the Chimichurri sauce they give you. But the next day I heated them up per their instructions in the oven and they tasted like they were just made. It was flaky, buttery, and they don't skimp out on the filling of delicious shredded beef with seasoning and potatoes. 

I've had Argentinean empanadas in Spain and these were better. I actually liked them more than the ones from Portos in LA. They are pricey but my family was super happy to have this treat from SB so it makes a great gift!",1
1913485,5,Went there for dinner last evening.  1st time there - but definitely not the last!  Awesome home style meals!  My husband got the fried chicken which looked like a photo from a magazine - and according to him tasted even better.  I got the sirloin steak which was the best steak I've had in ages!  I asked for a steak knife but should've tried cutting it first with the butter knife because it was so tender I didn't need the steak knife!  Friendly attentive staff. We were never rushed and everything was perfect!  Took home leftovers!  My husband had the blackberry cobbler with homemade ice cream for dessert.  Couldn't have asked for better!,1

598603,3,"Really liked the old Avalon better. Wanted to like this place but things that really bothered us was the ATTITUDE of everyone there. They have this fantastic bar drink menu but when you order one of the pricey drinks you have to practically beg the bartender to make it for you. God forbid you want a second or if you order one from the inept young guy bartender. They have Stella on special but they frequently run out of it. The owner walks around not even considering saying hello to customers. Bring back the old Avalon and attitude. Everyone here gives you the feeling that you are a nuisance. Till they change, my girlfriend and I will stick with  Limoncello. At least they have ULTRA friendly bartenders and the managers appreciate your being there which is why they don't need drink or food gimmicks to draw people in.",1
1419256,4,"About a week ago on a hot day we stopped in here for salads. I frequently concoct salads with inventive ingredients and scratch-made dressings at home, so salad is an entree I rarely order out. However, the Farmhouse salad caught my eye here, with its chopped turkey, roasted brussel sprouts, candied nuts, butternut squash, and goat cheese (a list of items that are usually NOT on hand in the fridge at home) so I went for it. I usually order salad dressing on the side because many commercial dressings are too sweet for my taste. However, the apple vinaigrette that accompanied this salad was (hooray) not overly sweetened - so I actually used the entire serving on the salad.

My only wish: that the serving sizes were smaller and the price proportionately lower - or that they offered a half-salad option. If the price point were $6-$7 for a salad and the portions more modest, I would dine here for lunch here MUCH more frequently. Salad is not the best doggie bag candidate. It wilts quickly. And if one is not heading back to a location with a refrigerator, leftovers go into the trash, which seems terribly wasteful to me.

My husband's taste in salad additions is almost polar opposite from mine, so sharing a salad is not an easily workable option for us.

PS: Shop Rite supermarket of Fairless Hills (Levittown Parkway) often issues register tapes that include coupons for buy one entree/get one at 50% (or $2 off entree plus beverage) on the reverse.",1

Hidden near the corner of W McCarron and Glendale, you'll find a dark little restaurant that makes piping hot burritos with your choice of meat. Their chips and salsa are great and the people (I assume all family members) are friendly.

They sell a limited supply of Mexican groceries, breads and piñatas. If you're thinking of making tamales, consider purchasing their prepared masa, to save a lot of time and work.",1

Our tour was led by Ryan, one of the owners and founders. He really knows his stuff. The thoughtfulness and science behind their craft really shines. Love their location by Mayberry Park, too. We bought a bottle of the chocolate liquor and got some ice cream to take to the park with us. Highly recommend checking them out.",1
805710,5,"This review comes from a first time floater. I'm going to do this review based on installations, customer service and the experience. The place is a cozy studio, very clean and organized. Once you arrive they explain you all the process, walk you to the room, show you the tank, the lights, door and amenities, give you some tips and clarify any doubts you might have. They have a very nice room with a shower, the tank and space to change and put your stuff which is kept super clean and with everything you might before and after floating. You have a shower right by the tank with shampoo, conditioner and soap. You need to shower before floating with soap and water to remove all oils. They also give you earplugs so water doesn't get in. Once inside you have a control for one light inside the tank and a roof heater in case you get cold. Everything is kept in top condition. Once I was in the tank I closed the door and shut the light off. I couldn't tell if my eyes were closed or open. Total darkness and silence. You can leave the door or the light on if you prefer. I loved my floating experience. It took me a while to get calmed and in the zone. The water supports you in such a nice way. It's like floating in the ocean but with absolutely no effort. The hour passed by and I was truly relaxed. Then you shower and are ready to go. It was a very nice experience. I would recommend it a 100%. Not only to those looking for a meditative space but also for those who just want to rest. It felt like an hour of solid rest. You might even fall asleep. It is 100% worth it and I'm confident I'll be coming back soon.",1
1198017,3,"I lived in Grande Oasis for maybe jus under 2yrs.  I want to start by saying the location is amazing one of the best in the city and they keep the grounds very will maintained. My building shared with a model unit so it was always clean as well. However here's why I moved. The leasing agent Justin has the absolute worst customer service, even from the beginning of my lease. If it was wasn't for a family illness that required me to stay I would've broke my lease based on the following. So my packages were being stolen from my door 3x 1 of which was a spare key to my car I had to begin having all package sent to a P.O. Box. Called Justin to complain. He told me "" no one else is having the issue and I happen to live in the building next-door and don't experience that issue"" okay but I am. Next issue  I decided to move out because although they claim that the community is luxury it's basically renovations to cover older amenities. My toilet would have black rust that would appear from time to time (other reviews mention this too) it has to be the plumbing. The maintenance staff came by several times to try and correct it but it never helped so I just stop complaining about it.  The baseboard were old and the paint was bumpy. The stove would pop whenever it heat up. Scary.  The walls are so thin I could literally hear my neighbors behind my headboard.  Please understand that I am one of the most considerate people when it comes to apartment living but that was very uncomfortable.  There are some other things that aren't even worth mentioning but I did give Justin a breakdown of all the issues that were wrong with the apartment  which were the reasons why I decided to not renew  my lease and his response was so nonchalant.  Lastly I had decided to try renew for six months last minute (  within a month)  because of the above family member illness and me needing to stay in the area.  He tells me that my apartment has already been leased and he can't tell them that it's no longer available when thats the exact thing happened to me when I about to move in and they found another apartment so why couldn't you do the same for this new tenant whom you have no rental history from. I paid every month on time. Never late and never any  residential issues but nevertheless I found a place that is way nicer has way more upgrades and it's cheaper so everything happens for reason.  They were fast about giving me my deposit refund and they offer move out cleaning which they can take out if the deposit.",1
5503114,5,"The wife and I have been meaning to stop in here for lunch sometime and finally got around to it. And now I'm sad that we didn't earlier. It's a weird ideal - picking your own sushi fillings / toppings - but it works. I didn't pick out anything too crazy, which helped make it enjoyable. I could see someone being disappointed if they don't know what they like and try to be too adventurous. Luckily, if you're that guy, they have house rolls that you can order to ensure a good sushi experience. All the ingredients we had on our rolls were fresh and tasted great. The miso soup and salad were also good, albeit nothing special. While the quality overall isn't gourmet, I believe the price reflects that (three rolls, two drinks, a soup and a salad for about $30? I'll take it!). The staff was also very helpful and guided us through the whole process since it was our first time. They really helped make our experience five star.

So thanks for a great experience, Sushi Boss. I think Arnold said it best: ""I'll be back.""",1
1279139,3,"It was okay I guess.  We got a happy hour 3-7pm 32 ounce domestic beer in a glass mug for $6.  There was a live dressed up Mexican band making it's way around the small restaurant to entertain, table by table, for tips.  You get a complementary huge basket of thin crispy tortilla chips and a bowl of salsa.  We ordered the shrimp, beef, and chicken fajitas for one to share, and it was plenty, except we needed more tortilla wraps.  The fajitas were seasoned okay, but the beef and chicken was on the dry side, and very little grilled veggies.  The side platter appeared to have been heated, so cold items were warm.  I've had way better fajitas. My star rating was 2 1/2.",1

The food was excellent. I had the homemade pasta, the trout, and the chocolate cake. My cousin had the celery soup and said it was outstanding. She also had the lamb and was impressed. 

All in all, I'm unsure what happened previously that people deemed this just an okay experience. We dine pretty frequently, and this was definitely an above average dinner. Definitely give it a try :)",1

Every seat in the house is great, they really treat guests like guests, and the show is always good; sometimes it's a surprise.  They do a good job of keeping the tradition of country music alive.  

What I loved about this place was how easy it was to get in, and to get out again.  The GOO makes it almost effortless.  

I am not a country music fan, but I loved the tour, I loved the history, and, most of all, I loved the show.

When we saw the one in airport, we had to give it a try. I could say now tried three different places, this comes at the last of my list. The beignets had oil smell and flavor which is an indicator that they reuse their frying oil. The fluffiness otherwise was right. They put all the beignets in a bag and dump powdered sugar on top. The ones in the bottom dont get covered; so you better shake the bag to distribute the sugar. The service is quick, they had already some premade and gave me the bag. It was still warm.  The cafe is located right by the main check in point. After passing the security turn right towards terminal B. It is located on right hand side.",1

5932262,3,"This was an A-Okay stop for gas and use of the restrooms.  This stop was the LAST before I made it home after 4 days of driving up and down I 75.  I was very road weary and not wanting to do more than get things done and get back on the road.

This travel center caters to both professional truck drivers and those of us driving personal vehicles.  There are two sides for parking, so the big rig trucks have their area and the smaller vehicles their own.  

I pulled up to the building to park and took care of everything I wanted inside first.   Despite being a larger facility, there were only two stalls inside the women's restroom.  Note: you have to walk through the game room/lounge and by the Men's restroom in a narrow hall to get to the Women's restroom.   The facilities, as noted by others, were very clean.  

All the expected candy, snacks and sundries for sale.  What I didn't notice was fresh fruit, so I made my exit and pulled up to the pumps.

The pumps are nicely spaced.  They have lanes painted showing they want you to pull in from one direction only.  After pumping, I was dismayed to see a notice on the screen that I should ""go inside for receipt.""   Grrrrrrr!   Nope, not gonna happen.  My plan was to pump and get back on the road.  I made note of the total and left.  Most days that might have been a minor blip but, in that moment, I wasn't a happy customer.

I can see how this travel plaza would rate more stars for professional drivers.  They have hot showers, a place to sit or play games in the lounge and there's a Dennys, which covers the basics for food.  All in all, they were A-okay for my needs.",1

2856343,3,"Wow is there a ton of philly sports pride up in this place.  I thought that would make it a bit difficult for me to enjoy the game being that I'm a Yankees fan, but I was welcomed anyway.

Simple setup.  You walk in to a split level bar.  The upstairs and downstairs are set up similarly with a large bar and tables along the side and then a few more after the bar.  TVs everywhere so you'll never miss any of the action.

I watched game 2 of the NLDS here and wow did it get crazy.  Granted, it was a ridiculous game to watch but I felt like the level of excitement here was equal or greater than when I've been to Citizen's Bank Park.  The place was painted with phillies jerseys.

Good beer selection for a sports bar.  Sure they are gonna offer specials on your american water-beers but I was able to drink a Sixpoint and a pumpkin ale.  I can't recall which one.

Anyhoo, good lively place to catch a game.  If you're a phillies fan, you'll like it even more.  Be prepared for a little bit of a fratty atmosphere.  Other than that, not a bad spot.",1

Pork belly was great, enoki mushrooms which tasted like buttered corn on the cob but were less messy were fantastic!!! The filet was great as well, the squid was probably my favorite part part it was so perfectly marinated! The down fall was they didn't explain how to cook things when we first got there and when we stayed too long they started cooking for us and rushing us at the end, also don't get the cubed beef it all has bones and is difficult to eat, it tastes great but it's not worth all the work and fat... over all I would recommend for a date or to atleast try it out and get your own opinion",1

202547,3,"I don't understand how this resort is rated a 4diamond? This was my first time to RENO and I hope that this resort is not above standard from the others. That would mean RENO would has different standards than what I think of a 4diamond resort.

The goal of any resort is to make you want to stay, spend money at their location, and feel good doing it. We had the need to leave the resort for dinner and wait in anticipation of when they were going to make us feel bad. 

I hear Atlantis is really good, in any case I will find another place to stay next time.

The service was seriously lacking all weekend. There were a few standout exceptions (Barb from terrace lounge should be the standard to model for the rest of the employees)

A few bad service examples:
Oceanu restaraunt - server never gave us plates to eat sushi off the platter. We had to ask for water refills. 

NEGATIVES:
Biscotti restaraunt - took 45 minutes for food to come out, food was cold, drinks took 15 minutes to show every time we ordered and service was horrible.

Fireside lounge - the waitress was condescending and had attitude. She brought the bill before we were done ordering or ready to leave. We later came to find out it was the end of her shift. But it would've been nice to know that and be told who our new waitress would be. 

Cafe - they ran out of some items and when asked for several other items for 2 people. I was given a response ""I think we can scrape enough together for one person."" Thankfully a customer in line recommended a cafe upstairs. A recommendation that would have made the experience better if the employee would have suggested it.

The casino - poor ventilation compared to other casinos. 

The room - while overall good. The shower drain would clog up after using  few minutes of water.

POSITIVES:
Club edge - was a great club. Bartenders provided great service and kept the drinks flowing, even created drinks based on our own recommendations. The visuals and music were top standard (DJ spider).

Spa services - I was told that the service was great and ran like a top rated spa.

Game floor - tables were fun and the dealers, I do mean all of them, were fun, helpful, and friendly.

Terrace lounge - live music by band ""miner"" who were really good. Good food and great service!

Island buffet - was one of the best I have been too, including Vegas. Service was lacking and this including the cashier (long story, but very odd experience).",1

They have a huge selection of their beers on tap in a wide variety of different styles as well as mixed cocktails and there's usually a food truck outside. Also happy hour daily until 5 makes this a great spot to grab a good drink for cheap if you're able to get a table!,1
6473386,5,Really great Greek food truly enjoyable. Great location on Mass Ave I know I'll be back soon,1
1762367,5,"When judging restaurants I compare them to each other not all rest of the restaurants I've eaten at. I have eaten at a lot of taco ""joints"" in my life and none deserved a 4 let alone a 5.  The service alone is worth all 5, but the food has to figure in there somewhere so it would be #6. They accommodated a party of 14 with only a days notice. They they helped me decide on the set menu for our party: 28 tacos-$1.75 ea (1/2 pork, 1/2 veggie) and 14 pupusa plates $6.99 ea (1/2 combo, 1/2 cheese and Loroco flower). Our beers, water and sodas were never empty  and the food came out fast. 

1st course: tacos. Good moist meat, tortillas a bit larger than usual and the veggie version was just above and beyond any veggie taco I have had. 

2nd course: Pupusa, rice, bean plates with a ""tutorial for those that didn't know you put that delicious cabbage slaw on the pupusa and it is okay to eat with your hands"".  I did not try the rice, because I don't usually and today was no different. The refried beans though, were so delish. Tasted a little bit like mole??? T

Each year I take my employees and their S.O.s out for dinner, this was by far the best holiday meal I have picked up the tab for in several years. 14 people left happy and full with enough leftovers for lunch the next day for only $231.00 (drinks included, before tip)",1
2137206,4,"I've been here multiple times, and I love everything about about this place! The food is delicious AND comes out fast. I've had their braised beef big bowl, shanghai noodles, and also their singapore noodles.  Good stuff. I usually don't finish the whole thing, so I just save it for later :)

Service is great, except I don't think the servers have ever told me what their names were!  My hot tea and water is always refilled when needed. If you go for lunch, they have a $13 Bento box special that includes three items.

Great place to bring a group of friends or family!",1
1165923,5,We had drinks here and decided to get the baked cheese! It was so delicious! The bread was soft and perfect for dipping! The cheese is almost whipped instead of stringy... great for dipping! It was incredible,1

91444,5,Took my dog to Ham + Bone for grooming today and I am blown away! Kelly did such an amazing job on my dog (with limited instruction from me)! Such a cute store with so many great products too. I will most definitely be back for all grooming/pet supply needs. So happy to have them in the neighborhood!,1
188122,4,"My last dining experience before going back to usually sunny California.  Now, this place is a place that the locals frequent for sure.  I wasn't sure if what I got was on the menu for the ""tourists"", but it was called the swamp plater (fried alligator, fried frog legs, fried crawfish tails, crawfish etouffee, turtle soup, and boiled alligator sausage).   I'd have to say that all of it tasted great.  I would order more individual items rather than the platter next time because I liked the turtle soup and the frog legs a bit less than the rest.  The etoufee was excellent as was the fried alligator and crawfish.  If you haven't noticed, they fry a lot of stuff.  

A note to the staff if you are reading this.... the more than my usual remains on my plate were because I had an extremely sore throat and had difficulty swallowing and NOT because of the food.   I'd eat at your restaurant any time!",1
5646594,5,Great taco deals on Tuesday AND 2.00 sangria. Great place to meet friends and hang out for a while.  Sit outside or in. Service staff is very friendly!,1
3620216,3,"For a late night eatery in the French quarter, one can't complain...the staff was super friendly, like most we've encountered. The one thing the server had no recommendations on the menu. When I see tater tots I order them! These, hmmm could have gone back, they were tasty when they were hot, once cold you could tell the cheese was nothing but a canned nacho cheese getting all coagulated. I had the crawfish Mac and cheese, the same cheese, I didn't mind it while hot but it was swimming in cheese that by the middle of my meal it was hard to continue eating. If in a late bind, a decent option at most.",1
925128,3,For the price of this sushi I was unimpressed with the quality. All of my rolls unrolled immediately after picking them up. I would give another star if they were cheaper for what we paid for. I was expecting to be impressed and I felt like I was eating cheaper carryout sushi. Also the bathroom is awkwardly placed behind the kitchen sort of and was a bit uncomfortable to walk through,1
137539,5,Best custard ever!  If you like ice cream come here!  We were in STL for 4 days and came here every day!  The best!,1
1437147,5,"I've grown up on these doughnuts. If your from Indy & you haven't had these, move  jk great doughnuts, nice staff. Always busy but worth the weight. The brownies are my favorite. Bring cash and be prepared for no parking spots.",1
6591809,5,"I have been looking for good, authentic Mexican food since leaving California over 20 years ago. I have finally found it at El Comal (The Griddle)! This easy to miss restaurant has fabulous food that starts with the chips and salsa. They make their own chips and the salsa has a nice little kick to it. I tried the chopped beef chimichanga and it was wonderful. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their menu, especially the differebt nachos offerings. I've found my new ""go to"" restaurant for Mexican food!! Comida maravillosa!!",1
888832,5,"Y'all I got to use a blowtorch! 
I wasn't allowed to use it by myself, but still BLOWTORCH!

I went to a glassblowing class in May (I think classes will be happening again come fall) that a friend scheduled for a huge group of us on a Friday night. There was a party room for us to bring food and drinks and then we all took turns making pumpkins (other choices include ornaments and eggs...but maybe tumblers in the future). 

I was semi-terrified that I was going to melt glass on myself or others but our instructor made sure we were safe...and y'know she let me handle the blowtorch so all the stars!

The selection of items for sale is diverse and beautiful and I love the old movie theater setting. Definitely a great time!",1
1370127,4,"For this dinner, I had a new dish of theirs, called the divorced egg. It was basically eggs with cheese and two kinds of salsa. It was served with tortillas, breakfast potatoes, and a lot of chips. On the advice of a couple of reviews, I tried the hot sauces, and that's definitely a must try. Everything was very tasty, and I'm going to have to go back and try the rest of the menu. There's not a lot of space here, so it's probably not good for groups, but it has a lot of character. Randomly, this place has Ski soda, which you don't see much in St Louis.",1
5007215,5,"While bar hopping with friends one night, we stopped into Tavern and right away I could tell it was far more social than Woody's.  There was a guy singing and playing piano, more specifically songs by Lady GaGa and songs from ""Wicked,"" so that added a nice little touch to the evening.  Didn't have any drinks here, but I know that will change because I will be back for sure!",1
76096,4,"I am so surprised that there is a nice sauna place in town. It is amazing how they manage this place. It is clean and nice. The style just like sauna in Asia.There are dry sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, and showering area. They provide everything you need. you don't need to prepare anything. Just walk in and enjoy!  There is also a resturant. Everything is 24 hours!  I will definitely come back again.",1
4136347,3,"Pretty sweet place to stop by at for the exhibit openings. Usually, they have some wine and cheese out for empty bellies. And then you have the art, which usually includes something that will have made it worthwhile to have visited.",1
3475438,3,"I want to see what the hype was about so we stopped in to grab a few cookies. There wasn't much of a selection, maybe 5-6 flavors of cookies. I got chocolate chip, M&M, and Butterfinger. For 4 cookies my total was around $15. The packaging was super cute which can be important. It kind of makes you feel like you've just picked up cookies from a high-end boutique bakery in NY.... or at least that what I felt like.
The cookies were just okay. The chocolate chip was a no for me. I could taste the flour and the consistency wasn't anything great either. The edges were hard and crispy. I've had waaaaaay better many many other places. Even Panera has a better chocolate chip cookie. The M&M was about the same. The Butterfinger was much better than the first two. It was really good and had ample amount of the candy in it. 
I'm not sure how to explain this but I don't think of Crumbl cookie as a cookie place but more of like a portable dessert shop. I think maybe their more innovative cookies might be better if you've not expecting  a cookie but a small decadent dessert. Crumbl cookie is like a cupcake and a cookie had a baby. I probably should have gotten the Key Lime Pie? Maybe just tried the Hot Chocolate? I will probably try something like that and change my expectations next time.",1
87952,5,Doreen is one of a kind. I've seen and heard her playing in the quarter for over 20 years. She always stops you in your tracks with her amazing vocals and the incredible way she pours her heart out through her clarinet . In my opinion she is the Queen of Royal Street and deservedly so.,1
4201819,5,"My favorite part of Day By Day is that they take their baked goods very seriously - not nearly enough places do this! Definitely try the ""jawn"" any ""jawn"" really. An invention by one of their bakers that will not disappoint you. Every baked good is perfection though!
Their food is delicious as well, you can find so many of your favorite meals with an unique twist on their menu.",1

4983676,4,"We tried this place out on a snowy Sunday a few months back since our usual brunch buffet at the Atlantis was closed for renovations.  It was not busy at all and we were seated right away.  First off, while this is a buffet, it's very upscale and feels more like a 5 star restaurant setting complete with a saxophonist wandering around playing live music. The waiters were fantastic and the food was impeccable. Everything was cooked perfectly and they had a decent selection for a small buffet. On the downside,  I didn't see any signs identifying what the chafing dishes contained in the breakfast area, forcing you to have to open each lid to see what it contained.  Also, it's expensive...almost $50 per person but the food and atmosphere made it worth it.  Couldn't see myself going back unless it was a special occasion due to the prices but I would recommend the brunch buffet to anyone who wants a much better-than-average buffet.",1
20228,5,"Excellent food. Excellent service. Came in 2 minutes before the grill closed, and I was invited to stay and enjoy my Bi Bim Bap. It was excellent. Fresh-tasting and well-balanced. I'll be back next time I'm in Nashville.",1

As she turned the picture around, I recognized my grandfather in his younger years.  What a great memory that was for me!  Julie Marie teaches classes on developing your own intuition.  Mystic Valley will be seeing a lot more of me. Dan L.",1

My spicy craving husband deemed ""happy food.""  Creamy and decadent spinach dip with hints of crab and lobster were served with fresh made tortilla chips.  I loved my filet mignon burger- with a hint of spice from chipotle mayo, perfectly balanced with melty Gouda and sweet carmelized onions.  Great service and Good choice- don't let the outside deter you",1
2474892,4,"It was my first time here. Don't judge a book by its cover. Although the ambiance is a bit odd (think former Pizza Hut), the food is delicious. 

Tip: come for lunch between 11 AM to 2:30 PM daily to get the lunch special. 

I ordered the beef bulgogi lunch special for $10.99. It included a generous portion of bulgogi, rice, 2 potstickers, kimchee and bean sprouts. 

It's comparable to Sa Ri One in South Tampa but definitely closer when I have a craving for Korean food.",1
2935429,4,"Bottom Line; A great little greasy spoon, Mom & Pop style breakfast place with character oozing out of every crack.   This is the kind of place that you hope you find while on a road trip - and here it is in the middle of old town!

I cannot believe that I have never been to this place, having grown up in Santa Barbara!  Shame on me!
      I was with most of my wife's family when I first sampled this spot.  I ordered one of the oven fired, egg dishes with everything in it and the wife got the incredible strawberry french toast sandwich thing.
      We split like we normally do and they were both awesome - the best of both worlds as far as breakfast goes.
    There were always people coming by the table and making sure that we had everything we needed.  I can only assume that this place is owned by an Asian family and as many places like this work, you see 5 or 6 members of the family helping out.
    All in all - a good spot!  Check it out!",1
538221,3,"If I was judging on pizza alone this place would probably get a 4. For me the crust was the best part. It has such great flavor! And when I reheated it in the oven it tastes even better when it's actually warm. The sauce is ok, a little too sweet but it was still good. A great piece of chicago style pizza. I'm giving this place 3 stars because the service all around wasnt great. I checked online to see what time they close, we were wanting pizza after a show at the ryman. We left the show at 1030 and it says 312 closes at 12am on fridays. So when we got there at 11:05 we knew we still had time. But when we walked in half the restaurant had chairs stacked on the tables. I thought maybe that side closed early or maybe just the bar served after a certain time. A server came running over saying they were on their late night menu because they were closing soon. I said well what time do you close? It's only 11 and online it said midnight. He shrugged his shoulders and said sometimes 11 sometimes 12. It was his way of trying to tell us to leave because they were trying to close early but if people kept coming in they probably couldn't. My husband told him we just wanted a few slices and we would be fast.  The bartender had the same oh dang why are you here and can you hurry up? attitude. He told is they had 5 slices left. I think we ordered 4 of them. They came out cold. Probably because the kitchen wanted to leave too. I got a box for my second slice because I knew they all wanted to go (it was 11:25 maybe by now) they did last call on drinks right around then too. I've worked in restaurants and bars my whole life. I understand wanting to leave. I understand closing early if it's slow. But if you want to close early put your closed sign up. I would have rather showed up to a closed restaurant than an open one where I was rushed out and didnt even get to enjoy a warm slice of pizza. Oh my husband ordered a drink and they didnt have all the ingredients. My husband said make it anyway, or just make something else. The bartender should have known to just make something else because if you are missing a key ingredient the drink wont taste right. Or at least add something else in it to replace what is missing. The drink was gross but for $11 we finished it. I do give partial blame to my husband on that. He never should have said to make it anyway. But he was drunk and has never bartended so what does he know?  Anyway slightly disappointed in this place but only because of everyone that worked there. My husband didnt care for the pizza but hes a thin crust New York style kinda guy. I might go back. But during the day so I know I actually have time to order, have my food heated up, and eat.",1

I haven't gotten any of the sides yet. The crispy tofu was stale one time I went, but it was still edible and the green curry sauce masked the taste. 

Calling Stacey out because apparently she gets $20 every time someone mentions her in a Yelp review! She is super sweet, along with all the other employees there. 

Great bang for your buck! Highly recommended.",1
4718744,5,First time checking out Modita and I can see why it's all the rage! I had heard about the restaurant but didn't know it was located inside the bottleworks hotel. I loved the atmosphere and it was a perfect spot for a girls night dinner. We all started off with the porch punch (I think it's called). It's a great refreshing drink that isn't too sweet and sugary. My friend who picked modita had been talking about the pork belly bao buns all week. So we started with the buns and the crab rangoons. The bao buns were amazing! We actually ended up getting another order. I liked the rangoons but it seemed like more crust than actual stuffing. Since we wanted to try everything we got a bunch of things to split. We got the tangerine chicken and umami noodles. The umami noodles were my favorite! We rounded off the night with the lemon dessert our waitress recommended. Perfect finish to an amazing meal. Next time around I am definitely going to try out the sushi!,1

WOW~!!?? What the H*LL was I doing the last three years here in Sahuarita??

What If I told you the absolute BEST Italian pie in Tucson, no Arizona, NO!!! the SOUTHWEST??!! was right here in Sahuarita?? Wanna' tell me otherwise? Good Lord above this pizza is absolutely de-LISH! 

The pie's aren't cheap but getting a quick 10 minute conversation in with the owner (Scott) you clearly see why he's been here for 13 years. And has a rock solid business!

He makes his pies with quality, delicious 'hefty sized' ingredients. I kid you not, it's quite a bit more than the $5.00 crap at your local 'Pizza-Pizza!' place... But dam*, this place was surprising! 

I'm a bit disappointed with my neighbors...they've been keeping this place a secret from me for far too long...Don't tell anyone I told you though.",1

5174412,5,"Not being as picky as I was in the past, I chose to put my big boy undies on try the Crab Meat Cheesecake. My wife got the New Orleans Pain Perdu (Fancy ass French Toast). 

The Crab Meat Cheesecake was actually really tasty. If you get the whole ""Cheesecake"" out of your mind, I think you'll enjoy this dish. It tasted nothing like Cheesecake. In fact, my wife said it tasted like crab cakes with a quiche like texture. We both thought it was really good. Especially with sauce. 

The New Orleans Pain Perdu was SUPER delicious. It's not your normal French Toast dish. The bread was like a baguette and the Dark Rum Syrup totally made this dish as tasty as it was. I'm a French Toast kinda guy and this is one of the best FT's I've ever tried. It surprises me how I don't see any pictures or reviews on it. This is a ""MUST""!!!

Everything from the food to the service was excellent. I would definitely return to this place.",1
930472,5,"We stopped here for dinner during a long bike ride. The place was packed at 5 pm on a Sunday afternoon. I'm sure with the quality of food here, it is packed at all times, so expect a wait. Everybody in my party ordered a pizza and six wings (yes we were fat asses) so we could try as many items as possible. The wings were out-of-the-world! I especially loved the Thai and the Garlic. The meat was incredibly juicy and the ingredients of the seasoning were wonderfully complementary, almost surprising at the first bite, but in a very good way. I loved all the pizzas we ordered as well, especially the Creme de Brie (truly creative - don't see this combination) and the Wild Mushrooms (loaded with different types of mushrooms). I loved that they didn't skimp on the mushrooms or try to overpower their flavors like many other artisan-pizza places would. Thank you! 

I think in the St. Louis and Southern Illinois areas, this may be the best wood-fired pizza place (I like Dewey's too but these pies are better)! Great service and wonderful selection of craft beers. We will visit again!",1

I've been hearing so much about federal donuts for almost half a year. Finally I decided to go and try it out. 

When I got there I was received  by a snobbish girl and very little options of donuts. I wanted something with Boston cream. She rolled her eyes and said ""the favor is on the icing""  lol !! Well, that wasn't the question I've asked but it was to early to argue. 

I went for a pumpkin donut and a chocolate one. As soon as I had the first bite... I got it! The flavor was heavenly sweet and the dough was firm but with a little bit of moisture to make it perfect! I'm so glad their donuts are 2,50 a piece! If not, I think I  would literally  eat a bucket of them! 

I forgave them for not having cream filled ones and I understood what was all the fuzz about. 

I would have giving five stars if it wasn't for the people working behind the counter.",1
2319767,5,"I've been to this place at least 10 times and it always taste absolutely amazing.  The only downside is that it's a little pricey, but the wraps / salads are huge. You can easily split a wrap with someone and be full.

The service is always great and they always allow you to swap ingredients out. There is nothing more frustrating than ordering something that is perfect except for two things on it that you don't like and having to pay for something you will simply remove. Big thumps up that they allow you to swap these items for something else you prefer. Not all restaurants do this and many want to charge for it.

The best wrap I've had has shrimp, chicken, goat cheese, bacon, avocado, baby spinach, walnuts and white cheddar cheese with either honey mustard dressing or fig vinaigrette. The wrap in the photo is this without chicken / cheddar cheese.",1

2460693,5,"It's just nice to see something done right. A restaurant/cafe/bar/performance space seems like a recipe for disaster, but thoughtful attention to the customer experience down to small details make this place a winner. Some things I appreciated when my husband and I visited for brunch yesterday:

* It can take a while to get seated, but there's a coffee bar right there where you can order yummy drinks and smoothies while you wait. There's also some seating, which in our case was taken up by families, but is a nice touch. 

* They have a new fancy water filtration system that they seem super proud of. We were informed up front that it would be an additional $1 per person for unlimited fancy filtered water and decided to go for it. The water was tasty, and I like that they are serving healthy options that don't trash the environment. 

* The main dining area is a big, open, high-ceilinged space with hardwood floors, brick walls, metal ceilings, and lots of iron. Spaces like this always look beautiful, except that they're usually so loud you can't hear yourself think. Front Street Cafe remedied this by lining the edges of the ceiling with unobtrusive sound-insulating panels that matched the corrugated metal ceiling, keeping the aesthetic but making it easy to have a conversation. The music was also the exact right volume. It's such a small thing, but it makes such a big difference. 

* The menu was incredibly vegan-friendly but still had options for die-hard carnivores (like my husband). A place where your vegan friends and your husband who will die without red meat can dine harmoniously? Yes, please. 

* The pancakes were delicious, and were heaped with sculptural levels of fresh fruit, almond cream, granola, and real maple syrup. I don't know what that other lady is going on about. Maybe next time she should just go to IHOP. 

* Nice beer list and drinks menu. We didn't partake (it was brunch, and we had to drive), but good to know for next time. 

* Every staff member we interacted with was lovely. Personable without being smarmy, accommodating without hovering. We shared some laughs. It was nice. 

* The bathrooms are spacious and have many stalls. Again, a small thing that makes a big difference!

So yeah, Front Street Cafe is #doingitright, and definitely a place I'll want to dine again the next time I'm in Philly.",1
562194,5,We decided to visit this location on a Saturday night because we didn't want to cook.....I mean who wants to cook on a Saturday. The food was Awesome!!!  After being seated we ordered water with lemon and a Mango Tea. We also decided to try the eggplant stack. These were amazing! The stack was cut like fries and served hot and ready with a delectable dipping sauce.  We ordered the Catfish Orleans and the  large Seafood platter. The portion size exceeded our expectations. Prior to our entree hitting the table we were given the best soft rolls and a side salad. Yummy in our tummies. The food was AMAZING,1
4212868,5,"Super convenient, excellent prices and outstanding customer service! I decided at the last minute to use extended parking to save a few bucks. First of all I was surprised by the low rate. I didn't have a reservation which was no issue. Everyone was extra friendly, professional and helpful. There are plenty of signs to directing you to the appropriate parking area. Checking was speedy and the van departed within a few minutes. Will absolutely use again!",1

1109040,4,"A buddy and I stumbled across Tartes walking through Old City the other day - I think I noted ""damn, that is one tiny establishment"", so we walked over to investigate. 

Tartes is pink and freestanding, with no buildings flanking it:  hard to miss. You order and pay at the same window out front. An array of delicacies are displayed in the front ledge. If you don't see something on the menu sitting out there, ask them - we got chocolate chip pecan cookies (sadly no red velvets today), which they took from a tray in back.

Cookies were awesome. Two or three inches in diameter, means you can have at least four bites, and not feel like a complete fatso eating cookies the day after Thanksgiving. Slightly crispy on the outside, and a nice balance of chocolates and nuts (e.g., you can taste the nuts but they don't dominate). I'd definitely come back to try cupcakes etc the next time I'm in town.",1

My satisfaction with my hair is a 2 or 3 but the girls at this location were so nice I can't make myself give that low of a review. 

I was at the salon for 3.5 hours for a partial highlight and cut. The color ended up much lighter than I wanted and my stylist needed several other stylists to come check the gloss she used after she realized she went too light with (I get that everyone has to start somewhere, but it's concerning when you realize your stylist isn't as experienced as you thought!). The cut is uneven (longer on the left side of photo and some wispy super long pieces) and the color is about 1/2 inch from my roots, which makes it look like it's already time to get my hair done again. 

I left feeling disappointed - but thankfully hair is easy to change!",1
6119382,5,"The Vampire Cafe is always a place we must visit when we are in New Orleans. The service is always amazing. The food is good and the drinks are delicious. It is a fun experience, especially if you appreciate vampires and spirits. You may even spot some vampires, especially around Halloween and the Vampire Ball. 

During our visit we were treated to a tea leaf reading by the owner, Marita Crandle. She is absolutely lovely and full of New Orleans knowledge.  Check out the books she has authored!",1
5489636,5,"Got back from a trip and found one of the heating zones was not working properly. Called and got an immediate appointment. Jack B (technician) showed up on time, quickly diagnosed the problem and fixed it with out issue!  Was an incredibly professional experience!!  The best part, we have a service contract and everything was covered. Thanks JC Heating team!!!  Highly recommend them if you live in Bucks county.",1

5989844,3,"Order to carry out pepperoni during the quarantine. I've always wanted to try this place. First impressions, walking in the building to pick it up the smell was incredible.  but honestly the pizza was a little underwhelming. Don't get me wrong it was good, just not as spectacular as I expected.  For those that like a sweeter sauce on the pizza, a real buttery crust, this place might be right up your alley.",1
6539354,5,"you must try the spinach salad.  I love the Blonde beer.  Sitting outside is a must.  You do seat yourself outside and dogs are welcome.  The staff is friendly and Brian, the manager, is so helpful when he recommends the gumbo with rice.  I would sure say this is one of the best places in Ybor for food!",1

77993,5,"I bought a car and drove it from NYC to Philly without a problem. But after I got home I somehow activated the alarm system and could not step on the brake without my car siren sounding obnoxiously; essentially, I had a car that I couldn't drive. Contacted AM&PM yesterday and had an appointment for this morning for the car to be looked at; also, I wanted to make a spare key since I was only given one master key. 

Well, I think I was somehow lost in the system because the technician did not show within the time frame. But after I called back I was told that he would be there within the hour, and everything went uphill from then on. Shay was courteous and professional and disarmed the alarm system and made a transponder key for me in no time. The key cost $145 (so it's definitely more than what the previous reviewer paid for but I think it also depends on the car; I think $145 is still reasonable for a transponder key though); all in all I got me a new key and a drivable car for $225 so I think that was pretty decent. I am satisfied with the service and will use them again if I ever have the misfortune of experiencing lock problems in the future.

Edit: Not even 20 mins after this review was up Shay called and apologized for being late to the appointment. He stated he would refund the service fee. I was very surprised and pleased that he took the time to look at the reviews and actually cared. As I said before, I was satisfied with the service because AM&PM really knew what they were doing. But now I'm impressed at the customer service as well.",1

6939967,5,"I've tried numerous Chinese take out places in South Philly and this is by far the best! I highly recommend their Crab Rangoon. Their crab rangoon has pieces of crab meat in it and are phenomenal. Their chicken lomein is also delish!!
Happy dragon also has a really cute dining room and is visually appealing and clean for those who are looking for more then take out. This is for sure a pennsport gem!",1
5629032,3,"Came here with a group of friends. There was a wait, but they timed it perfectly. 

Sat at a booth and our waitress was very nice, friendly, and helpful with the menu. We shared a guacamole, Mexican pizza, and blood orange margarita.

While everything was OK, it wasn't anything special....I'd rather go to the Cantina on Passyunk and get the same thing for about less than half the price. The margaritas here are SMALL!

The service was good, but I think this place is overrated.",1
5929362,3,"Ate there on 7-22-11. This place was recommended by  local residents, while I was  working in the city. Now my  review.
  With high expectations and a growling stomach. I walked into a really packed Caffe Caffe. This place is very popular. 
 I order the Smoked Turkey Sandwich with honey mustard on the side. The service was okay. The sandwich was okay.  That is until I added the honey mustard. This made the sandwich great.  This was some of the best honey mustard I've ever had. Top  3 without a doubt. Rich, smooth, creamy and flavorful. 
 Didn't try the desserts I will next  time. I will definitely  get something to put the honey mustard on again.",1
